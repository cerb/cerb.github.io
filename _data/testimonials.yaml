    I've worked with the Cerberus team for almost 15 years and continue to be a fan. Not only is Cerb a great product, but the team who develop and support it are a fantastic group of people. We are so appreciative of the teams' support and responsiveness; it translates into creating a product that allows us to be responsive to our customers, and we appreciate the many ways we can save time, energy (and money) by using Cerb as a cornerstone of our support infrastructure. Thank you!

    When ThinkGeek started using Cerberus we soon realized how much wasted time we had spent dealing with conventional email clients. We became so efficient with our email customer relations using Cerberus that we started to get more work done elsewhere in the organization. No kidding! It's so easy to setup, maintain and use that we simply cannot imagine what life was like pre-cerberus. This isn't a TV Commercial, Cerberus works!

    Cerb is one of the most flexible help desk software I've seen.  Its ability to adapt to nearly any business need or use case is astonishing.  The virtual attendants feature lets you process tickets and automate the assignment and oversight of tickets.  This has led to us being more productive and being able to do more work with fewer resources.  Thank you for making such a life-changing piece of software!

    We're loving Cerb6 over here at Kiva. We were especially elated when we were able to take advantage of the reporting capabilities introduced in 6.1 with the dashboard features. Also, upgrades have been a breeze, so we're able to stay on top of the newest features and bug fixes. Thanks for such a great product.

    Where others fail Cerberus delivers precisely what's needed. After spending only a short time with this product we knew we'd found the right one, quite simply Cerberus has given us the powerful communication tool we needed to rid ourselves of the disjointed communications that we experienced with using mail clients. Its introduction has been met with praise from our staff who have picked up the product with ease due to the intuitive and almost natural way that it works, all without a single hint of a complaint. Bottom line, Cerberus from implementation to operating environment has been straightforward, pain free and is capable enough to grow with our business - how many things in the I.T world can have the same said about them, not many!

    We have tried and used at least a dozen different systems and help desk programs, and only Cerberus was able to meet all of our needs. Cerberus is flexible enough to allow us to set things up and work exactly the way we want to -- across our different product lines. But it's also simple enough that team members can jump right in and start using it. This allows our team to focus on the real task of helping our customers, rather than learning and struggling with software.

    Having used Cerberus since 2003, we've seen first hand how the product has evolved. Version 5 can be summarised by a single word; amazing! We're able to interact with our customers better, delivering faster responses and increasing customer satisfaction. The flexibility of Cerberus has allowed us to fully integrate with our customer portal and management systems for all our brands which means more efficient staff. The team at WGM are legendary, receptive and open to new ideas and improvements. There are many solutions available today but Cerb5 is miles ahead of the competition.

    Of the CRM tools we've used, only Cerberus addresses the significant productivity threat posed by Spam and junk mail. Cerberus' trainable filters have saved us countless hours in sorting real customer emails from junk mail, and this has translated into faster response times for our customers, and high marks for our support team.

    Having gone through more ticket and email management systems than you can shake a stick at, we finally found Cerberus. We process hundreds of tickets per day, and found that Cerberus allows us to delegate these tickets/emails in such a way that it literally cut down our staff members' required manual input by at least 30%. I can not say enough about Cerberus that would do it justice. It is quite simply a god-send for a company such as ours...

    It's not every day that I get an opportunity to use such incredibly well thought-out and coded software as Cerberus. I've tried all of the open source helpdesk scripts and I can tell you that none of them even come close the Cerberus! I discovered Cerberus 4 when I decided (on a whim) to have another look at the Helpdesk script options-- it had been a while since the last time I had last stared with longing into the 'Kayako SupportSuite' pricing page (feeling sorry for myself). I found the Cerberus website through some web searching and was immediately impressed by the attractive design and wealth of information. I love the software and I'll probably be using for the rest of time. Very good job guys (and girls). I love you all.

    You guys are the best! You've gone above and beyond to help us through a tough time as we grow our business. We will definitely continue recommending Cerberus to our customers who need a helpdesk solution. We've used other helpdesk software before, but Cerberus has all the features we need to effectively manage our emails and tickets in a user-friendly manner. We started out with the free edition and we'll soon be upgrading to the Starter License and adding additional worker licenses as we continue to grow so that we can take advantage of the	full feature set, including time tracking and CRM.
