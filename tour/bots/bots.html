	<p>Automate common workflows by creating <a href="/docs/bots/"><b>bots</b></a> -- virtual team members who can respond to email, create and modify records, answer common questions, gather information conversationally, exchange data with third-party services, send reminders, notify people, monitor metrics, and do practically anything else that a human team member can.</p>
