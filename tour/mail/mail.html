	<h1>Cerb is your supercharged team inbox.</h1>
	<p>
		Cerb fetches new messages from your team mailboxes and creates <a href="/docs/tickets/"><b>tickets</b></a>.
		
		You can think of a ticket as a brief project based on a specific question or issue.

		The ticket’s profile page is a workspace that groups together email correspondence, comments, attachments, etc.

		Each ticket functions like a private mailing list. 
		
		Any number of contacts can be added to a conversation as <b>participants</b>, and they will receive a copy of all outgoing email messages from your team.

		{% comment %}
		Tickets are sorted into buckets within groups.

		The worker who is currently responsible for a ticket’s completion is its owner.
