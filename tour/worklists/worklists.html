	<p>
		Rather than having to repeatedly <a href="/docs/search/">search</a> for the same set of <a href="/docs/records/">records</a>, you can create a fully customizable <a href="/docs/worklists/">worklist</a> and add it to one of your <a href="/docs/workspaces/">workspaces</a>.
		Stay on top of deadlines and recent activity.
		Easily remain informed about what everyone is working on.
