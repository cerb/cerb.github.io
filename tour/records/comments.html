	<p>
		<b>Comments</b> can be added to <a href="/docs/records/">records</a> for documenting changes, coordinating work, and asking questions.
		This allows <a href="/docs/workers/">workers</a> to quickly share information, as well as building a historical record for later review.
		Specific workers can also be addressed with an <b>@mention</b> to send them a <a href="/docs/notifications/">notification</a> about the comment.
		You can quickly notify groups of workers using @mention shortcuts (e.g. @devs).
