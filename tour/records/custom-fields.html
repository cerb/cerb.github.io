		You can add your own <a href="/docs/custom-fields/">custom fields</a> on any <a href="/docs/records/types/">record type</a> to keep track of every important detail.
		You can group related custom fields together into an optional <a href="/docs/custom-fieldsets/">fieldset</a>. When a fieldset is added to a record it includes all of its fields at the same time.
