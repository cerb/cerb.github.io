	<h1>Cerb is your digital record-keeper.</h1>
	<p>
		At the core of Cerb is a <a href="/docs/records/">record</a> management system for organizing your team's data.
		There are <a href="/docs/records/types/">built-in records</a> for things most teams have in common (e.g. workers, groups, tasks, email).
		You can also <a href="/docs/records/#custom-records">create your own record types</a> for data that's specific to your team and industry.
