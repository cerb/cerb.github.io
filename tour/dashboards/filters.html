<div class="feature unit whole">
	<p>
		User-editable <a href="/guides/dashboards/filters/">custom filters</a> can be added to the top of workspace <a href="/docs/dashboards/">dashboards</a>. 
		These filters automatically apply to all of the dashboardâ€™s widgets.
		For example, a reporting dashboard can provide filters for a date range, date grouping (e.g. year/month/day), and a specific list of workers. Its various charts and worklists will adapt in real-time to changes in those filters from a single place.
