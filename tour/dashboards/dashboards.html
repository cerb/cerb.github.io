		The most common type of <a href="/docs/workspaces/">workspace</a> is a <a href="/docs/dashboards/">dashboard.</a> 
		Dashboards provide real-time visual insight with collections of customizable <b>widgets</b>.
		You can choose from pre-built widgets or create your own.
		Each dashboard responsively adapts to the screen size of whatever device is viewing it (e.g. desktop, laptop, smartphone, tablet, dedicated monitor).
