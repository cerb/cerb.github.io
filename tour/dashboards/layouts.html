<div class="feature unit whole">
	<p>
		By configuring the <b>layout</b> of a <a href="/docs/dashboards/">dashboard</a>, different <b>zones</b> become available for widgets to use. 
		For instance, in the "left sidebar" layout, there are zones for a left sidebar and a larger content area to the right of it.
		Widgets determine their size based on the zone they are in. 
		These zones will also collapse into a single column when a deviceâ€™s screen is too narrow.
