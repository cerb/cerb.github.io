<div id="seats"></div>

## What are seats?

Seats determine the maximum number of workers who can use Cerb at the same time.

For example, a team of 30 workers who are evenly split into three, non-overlapping shifts (morning, day, night) would only require 10 seats. That's the highest number of workers who would ever be logged in at the same time.

You aren't paying per worker account, so there isn't a penalty for inviting everyone to participate: full-time staff, part-time contributors, busy executives, interns, temps, contractors, partners, and volunteers.

## How do I install Cerb on my own hardware?

Read the <a href="/docs/installation">installation instructions</a> to get started.

<div id="renewal"></div>

## Do you provide a renewal discount for existing licenses?

Yes! We automatically add a 7.5% _"timely renewal_" discount to your invoice for any license that has not been expired for more than 30 days.

<div id="academic"></div>

## Do you provide an academic discount?

Yes. We offer a 25% discount in support of academic institutions.

To qualify for an academic discount, institutions must be accredited by an agency recognized by the U.S. Department of Education (or their own national equivalent).  All publicly funded K-12 and preschools automatically qualify.

<div id="non-profit"></div>

## What qualifies a charity or non-profit organization for a free license donation?

To receive a free Cerb license with ongoing software updates, a charity or non-profit must have a charter that seeks to improve the public good and be registered as a 501(c)(3) organization (or their own national equivalent).  The organization should be primarily funded through public donations or grants, and such contributions should be tax deductible by the donors.

<div id="opensource"></div>

## What qualifies an open source project for a free license donation?

To receive a free Cerb license with ongoing software updates, an open source project must have a website explaining the purpose of the project, 100% of source code available in a public repository like GitHub, and a self-hosted option with an open source license.

An open source license should only be used for that purpose, and not mixed with other commercial activity.
