**Cerb (10.2.3)** is a **{{ page.release.type }}** released on {{page.date|date:'%B %d, %Y'}}. It includes **{{ page.release.count}}** minor features and fixes from community feedback covering the [10.2](/releases/10.2/) update.  You can [follow these instructions](/docs/upgrading/) to upgrade.

# Changelog

## Added

* **[Automations/Scripting]** In automation scripting, added a new `|repeat(times)` filter that repeats a string the given number of times. For instance, this is useful to render a 1-5 star rating in a sheet.

* **[Worklists/Workers]** On worker worklists, added `calendar.id:` and `calendar:` quick search filters. Thanks to [Flexibits](https://flexibits.com/) for the feature request.

## Changed

* **[Records/Search]** On record worklist search queries, the `set.timezone:` filter now provides autocomplete suggestions.
  
* **[Dashboards/Widgets]** Sheet widgets (on cards, profiles, and workspaces) can use the `${placeholder}` syntax to sanitize untrusted user input in data queries. This is particularly useful for dashboard prompts.

* **[Worklists/Import]** On worklists, improved error messages when importing CSV files.

* **[Support Center/Dependencies]** In the Support Center portal, updated the jQuery dependency to 3.6.0.

* **[Portals/Bots]** Conversational Bot portals now serve the jQuery dependency directly rather than linking to a third-party CDN. This improves privacy and makes it easier to enforce a stricter Content-Security-Policy.

## Fixed

* **[Automations/Record Changes]** Fixed an issue in `record.changed` automations where the key expansion of record link custom fields in the `was_record_` dictionary was replaced with the current values from the `record_` dictionary. Thanks to [@mryanb](https://github.com/mryanb/) for reporting the issue.

* **[Automations/Mail/Routing]** Fixed an issue in mail routing with the `mailRouting.recipientRules` automation. The `bucket_name:` input is now optional.

* **[Portals/Interactions/Sheets]** In `interaction.website` portals, fixed an issue with selecting from multiple `sheet:` elements in the same `form:` continuation.

* **[Records/Choosers]** Fixed a bug with chooser fields in record editor popups, where the `(+)` create button remained hidden even after removing all selections. [[#1639](https://github.com/jstanden/cerb/issues/1639)]

* **[Profiles/UX]** On profile pages, a 'Not found' message is now displayed if the given record type isn't an exact match. Previously, this displayed the header and footer with no content.

* **[Setup/UX]** On setup pages, a 'Not found' message is now displayed if the given page doesn't exist. Previously, this displayed the header, menu, and footer with no content.

* **[Records/Merge]** Fixed an issue with merging records that have a 'Record Links' custom field. Thanks to [@myranb](https://github.com/mryanb/) for the report.

* **[Records/Search]** Record search queries now return an error message on invalid `set.timezone:` filters.

* **[Records/Search]** Fixed an issue in record search queries when searching for words made entirely of wildcard asterisks (`*`).

* **[PHP]** Cleaned up more deprecation warnings in PHP 8.1.

* **[Worklists/Search]** Fixed an issue when searching a worklist where a timeout when counting fulltext results could cause the remaining queries to hang until they also timed out.

* **[Records/Tickets]** Fixed an issue where editing a ticket record from its card didn't change the `updated` date.

## Security

* **[Security]** Fixed an issue with insufficient input validation that could potentially modify queries.

* **[Security]** Fixed an issue with path traversal (only possible for administrators).

* **[Platform/Security]** Added a `DEVELOPMENT_MODE_SECURITY_SCAN` framework flag for suppressing certain error messages during a vulnerability scan. This makes it easier to surface legitimate issues.

* **[Security/Avatars]** In the profile picture editor, added extra validation when fetching an image by URL.

* **[Security/Profiles]** On record profile permalinks to messages, drafts, and comments, improved the sanitization of record IDs.

* **[Security]** Disabled autocompletion on all password form inputs. Most browsers already do this, but doing it explicitly reduces false positives in vulnerability scanners.

* **[Security/Platform]** The Devblocks `::dieWithHttpError()` method now automatically HTML escapes error messages rather than relying on developers to do it. The new `::dieWithHttpErrorHtml()` method allows manually escaped output in the rare occasions it is needed.

* **[Security/Website Interactions]** In Website Interaction portals, the Content-Security-Policy no longer requires or allows the `data:` scheme for images. This was previously used for inline images in the stylesheet. The proactive stricter policy provides stronger protection against various XSS attacks.

* **[Security/Platform]** Disabled routing support for the `X-Rewrite-Url` HTTP header. This could be used for cache poisoning. The header was used by older IIS web servers for URL rewriting. The `IIS_WasUrlRewritten` server variable should now be used instead. For migrations, legacy IIS support can temporarily be re-enabled using the `APP_OPT_IIS_LEGACY_REWRITE` option in the `framework.config.php` file (disabled by default).

* **[Security]** The `.htaccess-dist` example for Apache now excludes the `vendor` directory from web access.

* **[Security/Templates]** In the template service, tightened up the sandbox policy to only allow approved tags.
