## Changed

* **[Performance]** On record editors, owner chooser menus no longer show profile images. In large environments this could result in hundreds of requests on a cold cache and trigger rate-limits.

* **[Records/Search/Worklists]** In record worklists, sorting a 'Record Links' column now orders by the number of links. Previously, this (less helpfully) sorted by linked record IDs. Thanks to [Flexibits](https://flexibits.com/) for the feature request and testing.
