# Changelog

## Added

* **[Automations/Changesets]** In the automation editor, a new 'Change History' tab shows the differences between the current version of the code and any previously saved version. This makes it possible to keep track of changed lines in the current version, as well as rollback to a previous version. The historical changesets are timestamped and are attributed to the worker who made them. [[#1619](https://github.com/jstanden/cerb/issues/1619)]

* **[Automations/Policies/Changesets]** In the automation editor, the 'Policy' tab now includes a 'Change History' button in the toolbar. This opens a popup to visually compare changes between the current policy and any past save. Changes have a timestamp and an author. Changes can be reverted individually or rolled back entirely.

* **[Automations/Events/Changesets]** The automation event editor has a new 'Change History' button. This opens a popup to visually compare changes between the current event bindings and any past save. Changes have a timestamp and an author. Changes can be reverted individually or rolled back entirely.

* **[Toolbars/Changesets]** The toolbar editor has a new 'Change History' button. This opens a popup to visually compare changes between the current toolbar and any past save. Changes have a timestamp and an author. Changes can be reverted individually or rolled back entirely.

* **[Automations]** In automations, added a `file.write:` command for creating temporary automation resource files to hold various kinds of data. The `inputs:content:` can define either `bytes:`, `text:`, or `zip:`. Using `content:zip:` will create a ZIP archive with a list of one or more `zip:files:`, each with a path and URI to an attachment or automation resource. An optional `zip:password:` encrypts the ZIP. An optional expiration date for the file can be provided with `inputs:expires@date:`. The `output:` includes keys for: `uri`, `mime_type`, `expires_at`, `size`, and `id`. [[#1637](https://github.com/jstanden/cerb/issues/1637)]

* **[Automations/Files]** In automations, the `file.read:` command now accepts an optional `inputs:password:` for decrypting password-protected ZIP archives.

* **[Records/Search/Links]** In record search queries, `links.(type).(field):` filters now exist for all custom fields that link to the current record type (record link, record links, worker). These are deep search filters that can filter the other side of the link. For instance, on a workers worklist, the query `links.ticket.testFieldset_worker:(status:o)` would return all workers linked to by the `testFieldset_worker` custom field, where the field's ticket is in the open status. [[#1215](https://github.com/jstanden/cerb/issues/1215)]

* **[Interactions/Worker]** In worker interactions, added a `query:` element to form continuations. This builds a search query with autocompletion for the given record type. This is particularly useful for user-level filtering above a sheet of records.

* **[Worklists/Export]** When exporting records from a worklist, a new 'Build' option uses KATA to provide full customization of the exported columns and values, including transformations using scripting filters. For instance, from a ticket worklist, a single exported 'Content' column can now combine mask, subject, and the first 2500 characters of the initial message content, while excluding quoted content. This makes it much easier to export content from Cerb directly into other services (e.g. Huggingface for building machine learning models). This is supported in all export formats: CSV, JSON, JSON Lines, and XML. Previously, only individual fields could be exported without any transformations, which often required a custom script to further format the data.

* **[Worklists/Export]** When exporting from a worklist, a new 'JSON Lines (.jsonl)' format is available. This exports one JSON object per line. The format is used by services like Huggingface.

* **[Queues/Schedule]** In queues, messages can now be pushed into a queue with delivery at a future date. This makes it much easier to implement scheduled automations. For instance, an escalation workflow can push a message into a queue with delivery in 2 hours. An automation timer could drain the queue at regular intervals. When processing those future messages, they could escalate an associated ticket if it didn't have any action in the meantime. The same process could also handle workflows like auto-closing tickets that wait longer than a certain deadline, etc.

* **[Automations/Log]** Automations now automatically log scripting syntax errors when they are encountered. Previously, scripting errors failed silently.

* **[Data Queries/Subtotals]** In `worklist.subtotals` data queries, date fields can now be grouped by `@hourofdayofweek` for categories like 'Wednesday 16:00'. This is useful for computing a baseline average week based on any date range. Thanks to [1Password](https://1password.com/) for the feature request.

* **[Automations/HTTP]** In automations, the `http.request:` action can now set the key `inputs:response:response:` to always receive an automation resource as the response. Previously, an automation response was only returned for content over 1MB. This is useful when sending an automation resource URI to another function for processing, where passing the raw bytes would be inefficient.

* **[Platform/VObject]** Added a VObject service to the Devblocks platform for parsing the vCard and iCalendar formats in attachments. This enables automation worklists like synchronizing calendar events from Google Calendar.

* **[Automations/Scripting]** In automation scripting, added a `vobject_parse(string)` function for processing vCard (VCF) and iCalendar (.ics) files in automation workflows. The function takes a block of text in VObject format as input, and returns a parent/child data structure. [[#318](https://github.com/jstanden/cerb/issues/318)]

* **[Worklists/Usability]** On record worklists, a range of rows can be quickly selected (or deselected) by holding `<SHIFT>` while clicking the beginning and end of the range.

* **[Automations/Scripting]** In automation scripting, added a new `date_lerp(date_range,unit,step,limit)` function for interpolating the timestamps between two dates with the given `unit` (`minute`, `day`, `week`, `month`) and `step` (1, 5, 10).

* **[Interactions/Worker]** Worker interactions can now `return:alert:` to display a time-limited message at the top of a worker's browser. This is particularly useful to confirm non-interactive actions (e.g. "Copied!").

* **[Interactions/Worker]** Worker interactions can now `return:clipboard:` to copy arbitrary text to the worker's clipboard. Due to browser security rules, this feature only works for any interaction that starts from a user gesture (mouse click, screen tap). For instance, a toolbar on a ticket profile page can include a button like 'Copy ticket mask' or 'Copy ticket URL'. Editor toolbars can also implement a 'Copy' shortcut. Thanks to [1Password](https://1password.com/) for the feature request. [[#1387](https://github.com/jstanden/cerb/issues/)] [[#1572](https://github.com/jstanden/cerb/issues/1572)]

* **[Interactions/Worker]** Worker interactions can now `return:open_link:` to open an arbitrary URL as a new tab in a worker's browser. This is useful for automations and integrations with third-party services. For instance, opening a page on a billing service to generate an invoice. Thanks to [@mryanb](https://github.com/mryanb) for the feature request. [[#1503](https://github.com/jstanden/cerb/issues/1503)]

* **[KATA/Platform/Developers]** When parsing or emitting KATA, an option is now available to preserve `#` comments. Previously, comments were always discarded. This is particularly useful in functionality that updates an existing KATA document by parsing it, modifying the tree, and re-emitting it.

* **[Platform/Records/Changesets]** Implemented a 'record changesets' service in the platform. This can provide any record type with authored and timestamped change management for arbitrary fields (e.g. automation policy and script). SHA-1 hashes are used for change detection. Infinite history is supported with archival to long-term storage objects.

* **[Automations]** Added the `scripting.function` automation event. These automations can be by invoked using the `cerb_automation(uri,inputs)` function in any feature that supports scripting. The function returns keys for `exit_state` (exit, return, error) and `return` (an arbitrary dictionary). This brings the full functionality of automations to email signatures, snippets, legacy bot behaviors, automation event bindings, toolbars bindings, etc. For instance, a snippet could use an automation to dynamically generate content based on the target record or current worker. This solves many feature requests. [[#1522](https://github.com/jstanden/cerb/issues/1522)]

* **[Data Queries/Subtotals]** In `worklist.subtotals` data queries, date-based fields can now be grouped by `@minute`. This makes it easier to review trends over shorter timeframes (e.g. trailing 1-4 hours). With `@hour` grouping, it's unclear if activity is concentrated at the beginning or end of an hourly period.

* **[Automations/Charts]** Added the `ui.chart.data` automation event. This can use custom logic and/or external resources to generate data for Chart KATA widgets on cards, profiles, or workspaces. The automation should `return:data:` with one or more keys each containing an array of series data. For instance, `return:data:series0@csv: 1,2,3,4,5`.

* **[Data Queries/Subtotals]** In `worklist.subtotals` [data queries](/docs/data-queries/worklist/subtotals/), date fields can now be [grouped](/docs/data-queries/worklist/subtotals/#date-histograms) by `@quarter` (e.g. `2022-Q4`). Thanks to [@mryanb](https://github.com/mryanb/) for the feature request. [[#1410](https://github.com/jstanden/cerb/issues/1410)]

* **[Data Queries/Subtotals]** In `worklist.subtotals` [data queries](/docs/data-queries/worklist/subtotals/), date fields can now be [grouped](/docs/data-queries/worklist/subtotals/#date-histograms) by `@quarterofyear` (e.g. `Q3`). Thanks to [@mryanb](https://github.com/mryanb/) for the feature request.

* **[Data Queries/Subtotals]** In `worklist.subtotals` [data queries](/docs/data-queries/worklist/subtotals/), date fields can now be [grouped](/docs/data-queries/worklist/subtotals/#date-histograms) in 5-minute blocks with `@minutes/5` (e.g. `2025-01-09 04:25:00`). Thanks to [1Password](https://1password.com/) for the feature request.

* **[Data Queries/Subtotals]** In `worklist.subtotals` [data queries](/docs/data-queries/worklist/subtotals/), date fields can now be [grouped](/docs/data-queries/worklist/subtotals/#date-histograms) in 15-minute blocks with `@minutes/15`.

* **[Data Queries/Subtotals]** In `worklist.subtotals` [data queries](/docs/data-queries/worklist/subtotals/), date fields can now be [grouped](/docs/data-queries/worklist/subtotals/#date-histograms) in 30-minute blocks with `@minutes/30`.

* **[Sheets/Interactions]** In worker interactions, `sheet:` form elements now support a new `interaction:` column type. This renders a label with a link. Clicking the link starts an interaction with the given `inputs:`. For instance, a sheet of IP addresses could use an interaction column to make the IPs clickable, and then show a map with location and hostname details. [[#1630](https://github.com/jstanden/cerb/issues/1630)]

* **[Worker Interactions/Toolbars]** In worker interactions, `editor:` form elements can now define a custom `toolbar:`. This receives `caller_params:` for `selected_text`, `cursor_row`, `cursor_column`, and `value` (full text). Interactions can `return:snippet:` with text to paste into the editor at the cursor.

* **[Interactions/Worker]** In worker interactions, added a `fileDownload:` element to form continuations. This displays a form button that downloads an attachment or automation resource file when clicked. This is particularly useful for interactions that generate large or binary output, like a dynamic image, a CSV/JSON export, or a ZIP archive.

* **[Automations/Files]** In automations, the `file.read:` command has a new `filters:` option to modify the stream output from an attachment or automation resource. Using `filters:gzip.inflate:` will decompress a gzipped file before returning the contents. For instance, this can be used to read a compressed `.xml.gz` DMARC delivery report from a file attachment.

## Changed

* **[UX/Editors]** All popups with editable fields now display an "Are you sure?" confirmation when using the `ESC` shortcut to close them without saving. Previously this functionality was only implemented for specific popups. This also fixes an issue with confirmation popups in recent versions of Safari.

* **[Performance/Records]** Improved the performance of many ticket record searches. These queries now return only an ID (and optionally the sort field) and each page of results has its fields expanded when displayed. This allows more searches to be resolved entirely from an index. It also uses less memory which can lead to more efficient join strategies.

* **[Platform/Dependencies]** Updated the Horde IMAP library to version 2.30.4.

* **[Platform/Dependencies]** Updated the jQuery dependency from 1.11.2 to 3.4.0. [[#480](https://github.com/jstanden/cerb/issues/480)]

* **[Platform/Dependencies]** Upgraded the jQuery UI dependency from 1.11.2 to 1.13.1.

* **[Platform/Dependencies]** Updated the jQuery caret plugin to 1.3.7.

* **[Platform/Dependencies]** Updated the jQuery hoverIntent plugin from 1.8.1 to 1.10.2.

* **[Platform/Dependencies]** Updated the Ace Editor library from 1.4.7 to 1.4.14. [[#1437](https://github.com/jstanden/cerb/issues/1437)]

* **[Tour]** Updated the tour to match the latest UI and functionality.

* **[Automations/Behaviors]** Bot behaviors on the deprecated events 'Mail assigned in group', 'Mail moved to group', and 'Mail closed in group' have been moved to the `record.changed` automation event. This also ensures custom fields are set on ticket records before the behaviors start. These behaviors should be migrated to automations since we plan on retiring behaviors after version 11.0.

* **[Records/Avatars]** Record profile images may now be up to 256x256 pixels. Previously they were resized to a maximum of 100x100. While still displayed in smaller sizes most of the time, the extra resolution keeps images sharp on high-definition displays. [[#1047](https://github.com/jstanden/cerb/issues/1047)]

{% comment %}
## Deprecated
{% endcomment %}

## Removed

* **[Search/Sphinx]** Removed Sphinx search engine support.

* **[Platform/Dependencies]** Removed the qTip library.

* **[Platform/Dependencies]** Removed the jQuery autosize plugin.

* **[Platform/Dependencies]** Removed the jQuery cookie plugin.

* **[Platform/Dependencies]** Removed the jQuery validate plugin.

## Fixed

* **[Data Queries/Subtotals]** In `worklist.subtotals` data queries, fixed an issue that prevented the same field from being used multiple times in the `by:` option. For instance, `by:[created@dayofweek,created@hourofday]`. [[#1372](https://github.com/jstanden/cerb/issues/1372)]

* **[Devblocks/Routing]** Fixed an issue in Devblocks request routing when friendly URLs are disabled. Depending on webserver configuration, it was possible to use any prefix in place of `/index.php/` as long as it had the same length.

* **[Scheduler/Storage]** In the `cron.storage` scheduler job, optimized the query used to determine when objects can be archived. Previously, this could log slow queries in large databases due to table scans.

* **[Interactions/Workers/Drafts]** On worker interactions in an `await:draft:` continuation, aborting the draft popup now properly continues the interaction.

* **[Mail/Automations/Validation]** When composing or replying to mail and a validation interaction has an error, it will now be logged and ignored rather than preventing workers from sending the message.

* **[Records/Validation]** Fixed an issue with the 'max length' and 'truncation' options on validation when text contained multibyte characters. Text was being truncated on bytes, and in certain situations it was possible to truncate in the middle of a Unicode character, resulting in an invalid string. Truncation no longer splits multibyte characters.

## Security

* **[Security]** Cerb no longer responds to unsupported HTTP verbs: HEAD, OPTIONS, etc. Outside of the API, we only respond to GET and POST.
  
* **[Security/Links]** When special characters are found in a URL route (e.g. `/profiles~~~/ticket/1`), a 'Not found' error is now displayed. Previously, these characters were silently removed and the request continued normally.

* **[Security/Sessions]** Improved cookie security by using an explicit path and setting the 'SameSite' directive.

* **[Security/CSP]** Added a default `Content-Security-Policy` HTTP header. This prohibits potentially malicious cross-origin references to content like images, scripts, and stylesheets. External images in HTML email still work because they proxy through the server on the same origin.
  
* **[Security/CSP]** Removed the built-in Gravatar integration from the profile image editor. This can be reimplemented with automations where desirable.
