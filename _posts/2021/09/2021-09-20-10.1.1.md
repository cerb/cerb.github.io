**Cerb (10.1.1)** is a **{{ page.release.type }}** released on {{page.date|date:'%B %d, %Y'}}. It includes **{{ page.release.count}}** minor features and fixes from community feedback covering the [10.1](/releases/10.1/) update.  You can [follow these instructions](/docs/upgrading/) to upgrade.

* **[Automations/Scripting]** In automation scripting, added a [\|column(key)](/docs/bots/scripting/filters/#column) filter for extracting a key from each item in an array.
  
* **[Automations/Scripting]** In automation scripting, added a [\|filter(func)](/docs/bots/scripting/filters/#filter) filter for filtering an array of sequences or objects. The `func` argument is an arrow function like `(v,k) => v > 5` that returns `true` (include) or `false` (exclude) for each item.

* **[Automations/Scripting]** In automation scripting, added a [\|map(func)](/docs/bots/scripting/filters/#map) filter for applying a function to each item in an array to create a new array. The `func` argument is an arrow function like `(v,k) => output` that returns the new value for each item.

* **[Automations/Scripting]** In automation scripting, added a [\|reduce(func,initial)](/docs/bots/scripting/filters/#reduce) filter for reducing an array of items to a single value. The `func` argument is an arrow function like `(carry,v) => carry + v` that receives value of the current item and the output value of all past calculations (carry).

* **[Automations/Scripting]** In automation scripting, added a [\|values](/docs/bots/scripting/filters/#values) filter for returning the values of an array with sequential keys. This is the filter equivalent of the [array_values()](/docs/bots/scripting/functions/#array_values) function.

* **[Automations/Scripting]** In automation scripting, added a [cerb_calendar_time_elapsed(calendar,date_from,date_to)](/docs/bots/scripting/functions/#cerb_calendar_time_elapsed) function for calculating the time elapsed between two dates using calendar availability. The `calendar` argument is an ID (and will eventually be a URI once those are supported by calendars). Thanks to [@beatbesmer](https://github.com/beatbesmer) for the feature request!

* **[Platform/Templates]** In the template builder service, we now catch argument count errors in scripting with custom functions. Previously these triggered a FATAL in PHP.

* **[Custom Fields/Search]** On worker-based custom fields, we now generate search filters for `fieldName:` and `fieldName.id:`. In data queries, this makes it possible to request the worker ID or label.

* **[Data Queries/Subtotals]** On `worklist.subtotals` data queries, when using a worker custom field in the `by:`, the full worker name is used as the label rather than the ID. This is what would normally be expected on something like a pie chart. If desired, the ID can be used with `by:[fieldName.id]` instead.

* **[Interactions/Sheets]** Fixed an issue in interaction sheet elements when filtering by a data set with keys and no values. Thanks to [1Password](https://1password.com/) for the report!

* **[Tickets/Reports]** On ticket records, the 'First Response' field is now computed as the time elapsed from ticket creation until the first outgoing message. Previously, the field had the same value as the first outgoing message's response time. This could be misleading if a new ticket had several inbound messages and the most recent was replied to first. [[#1524](https://github.com/jstanden/cerb/issues/1524)] Thanks to [@keith-chargeover](https://github.com/keith-chargeover/) for the report!

* **[KATA/Automations]** Added more error checking when parsing Events KATA before passing it to the event handler. With invalid KATA, `false` was returned, which caused a `PHP FATAL` for any method expecting an array of handlers. In the worst case, invalid `mail.route` KATA could prevent the parser from processing new mail (though these messages were in the fail queue for retry).

* **[Interactions]** Fixed an issue in worker interactions, in `await:form:` continuations, with `text:` elements. This was attempting to truncate very long non-string values.

* **[Worklists/Validation]** Added a warning on worklists with invalid search filters in their required query. Previously these were silently ignored.
