# Current changelog

* **[Mail/Parser]** Cerb now properly handles FormMail-style email headers, like `From: customer@example.com (Customer Name)`.

* **[Toolbars]** Added a `draft.read` toolbar for adding interactions to draft previews on ticket profiles.

* **[Mail/Compose]** Compose drafts now properly save custom fields and fieldsets. [[#1083](https://github.com/jstanden/cerb/issues/1083)]

* **[Mail/Drafts]** Reply drafts properly save and reload custom fieldset values.

* **[Time Tracking]** Time tracking records are now created when the timer starts. Pausing a time tracking timer saves its progress to the server.

* **[Time Tracking]** Time tracking timers can be resumed on previously saved records.

* **[Time Tracking]** When resuming a time tracking timer from the editor, changes to fields and comments are now saved first. Previously these changes were lost when the timer was resumed.

* **[Time Tracking]** Time tracking time entry in human-readable units (e.g. "1 hour, 15 mins, 5 seconds"). Previously time entries only tracked in minutes.

* **[Time Tracking]** Time tracking timers are now measured in seconds rather than minutes. This allows a previously saved timer to be resumed without rounding to the nearest minute.

* **[Records/Search/Fulltext]** In record search queries, fulltext filters can now use parentheses to specify a mix of phrases and terms. For instance, `text:("an exact phrase" other terms)`.

* **[Sheets/Security]** Sheets now automatically HTML escape all placeholders in templates by default. This can be overridden in certain situations with the `|raw` filter.

* **[Records/Search]** There is no longer a results limit when fulltext searching using a MySQL index (rather than Elasticsearch). Instead, inefficient searches are now automatically aborted by the existing query time limits. Every filter is now involved in queries that mix fulltext and field filters. [[#1445](https://github.com/jstanden/cerb/issues/1445)]

* **[Records/Search]** All fulltext search filters (on MySQL indexes) now support negation. For instance, `text:!(not these words)`

* **[Search/Messages]** Added a new fulltext search index for common message headers: `from`, `to`, `cc`, `delivered-to`, `x-forwarded-to`, and `x-mailer`.

* **[Records/Search/Messages]** On message records, added a `header.deliveredTo:` search filter.

* **[Records/Search/Messages]** On message records, added a `header.from:` search filter.

* **[Records/Search/Messages]** On message records, added a `header.cc:` search filter.

* **[Records/Search/Messages]** On message records, added a `header.to:` search filter.

* **[Storage/MySQL]** Improved MySQL 8.x support by combining the `id` and `chunk` indices on the `storage_` tables.

* **[Records/Profiles]** Added profile pages for message records. This makes it possible to isolate a single message, which simplifies workflows like printing.

* **[Records/Profiles/Messages]** On message profile pages, the 'Ticket Conversation' widget can now display a single message with full functionality (e.g. toolbars, reply, comment, attachments).

* **[Records/Profiles/Drafts]** On draft profile pages, the 'Ticket Conversation' widget can now display a single draft with full functionality (e.g. resume, comment). [[#1360](https://github.com/jstanden/cerb/issues/1360)]

* **[Platform/Sessions]** Increased the possible length of IPs in sessions. The limit was previously 40 characters, but some IPv6 (e.g. IPv4 mapping) can be slightly longer. [[#1460](https://github.com/jstanden/cerb/issues/1460)]

* **[Automations/Mail]** Implemented the `mail.draft` automation event. Automations can modify any property on a new or resumed draft after a worker clicks on a 'Compose'  or 'Reply' button, but before the editor popup opens. Automations on this event are cumulative -- multiple automations can modify the draft, with subsequent changes on the same fields overwriting earlier ones. When setting `custom_fields:`, their `uri` field can be used as the key instead of IDs. New custom field changes are merged with existing fields. This event drastically simplifies workflows that modify drafts (e.g. always adding a `Bcc:` field). Previously, these workflows used 'Before composing/replying' behaviors, which required fragile Javascript.
  
* **[Automations/Mail]** Implemented the `mail.sent` automation event. Automations can perform actions after an outgoing message is sent by a worker.

* **[Mail]** Refactored mail sending functionality to generate content separately for every combination of saved/sent and html/text. For instance, a content modification can be targeted at only the 'sent html' part. Previously this was limited to saved/sent, but it couldn't target html/text.

* **[Mail/Markdown/UX]** When generating a plaintext body from a Markdown-formatted outgoing message, image tags with alt text are now properly matched and converted.

* **[Mail/Relays]** Inbound messages from workers through the email relay now generate a draft before being parsed. If the message fails to send (e.g. SMTP issues), it will remain a draft and retry rather than disappearing.

* **[Automations/Mail]** Implemented the `mail.send` automation event. Automations can modify sent message drafts before they are delivered. For instance, appending a unique survey link to only the sent+html message (not text, nor the copy Cerb saves), setting custom fields, or adding custom mail headers to prevent Sendgrid from rewriting the `Message-Id:` header. Content modifications can target any combination of text/html on the sent/saved message.

* **[Search/UX]** Search queries with unknown filters now return an error and no results. Previously, unknown filters were ignored, which could have unintentional effects.
