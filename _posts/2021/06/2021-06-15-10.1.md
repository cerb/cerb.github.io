# Current changelog

* **[Mail/Parser]** Cerb now properly handles FormMail-style email headers, like `From: customer@example.com (Customer Name)`.

* **[Toolbars]** Added a `draft.read` toolbar for adding interactions to draft previews on ticket profiles.

* **[Mail/Compose]** Compose drafts now properly save custom fields and fieldsets. [[#1083](https://github.com/jstanden/cerb/issues/1083)]

* **[Mail/Drafts]** Reply drafts properly save and reload custom fieldset values.

* **[Time Tracking]** Time tracking records are now created when the timer starts. Pausing a time tracking timer saves its progress to the server. [[#1243](https://github.com/jstanden/cerb/issues/1243)]

* **[Time Tracking]** Time tracking timers can be resumed on previously saved records.

* **[Time Tracking]** When resuming a time tracking timer from the editor, changes to fields and comments are now saved first. Previously these changes were lost when the timer was resumed.

* **[Time Tracking]** Time tracking time entry in human-readable units (e.g. "1 hour, 15 mins, 5 seconds"). Previously time entries only tracked in minutes.

* **[Time Tracking]** Time tracking timers are now measured in seconds rather than minutes. This allows a previously saved timer to be resumed without rounding to the nearest minute.

* **[Records/Search/Fulltext]** In record search queries, fulltext filters can now use parentheses to specify a mix of phrases and terms. For instance, `text:("an exact phrase" other terms)`.

* **[Sheets/Security]** Sheets now automatically HTML escape all placeholders in templates by default. This can be overridden in certain situations with the `|raw` filter.

* **[Records/Search]** There is no longer a results limit when fulltext searching using a MySQL index (rather than Elasticsearch). Instead, inefficient searches are now automatically aborted by the existing query time limits. Every filter is now involved in queries that mix fulltext and field filters. [[#1445](https://github.com/jstanden/cerb/issues/1445)]

* **[Records/Search]** All fulltext search filters (on MySQL indexes) now support negation. For instance, `text:!(not these words)`

* **[Search/Messages]** Added a new fulltext search index for common message headers: `from`, `to`, `cc`, `delivered-to`, `x-forwarded-to`, and `x-mailer`.

* **[Records/Search/Messages]** On message records, added a `header.deliveredTo:` search filter.

* **[Records/Search/Messages]** On message records, added a `header.from:` search filter.

* **[Records/Search/Messages]** On message records, added a `header.cc:` search filter.

* **[Records/Search/Messages]** On message records, added a `header.to:` search filter.

* **[Storage/MySQL]** Improved MySQL 8.x support by combining the `id` and `chunk` indices on the `storage_` tables.

* **[Records/Profiles]** Added profile pages for message records. This makes it possible to isolate a single message, which simplifies workflows like printing.

* **[Records/Profiles/Messages]** On message profile pages, the 'Ticket Conversation' widget can now display a single message with full functionality (e.g. toolbars, reply, comment, attachments).

* **[Records/Profiles/Drafts]** On draft profile pages, the 'Ticket Conversation' widget can now display a single draft with full functionality (e.g. resume, comment). [[#1360](https://github.com/jstanden/cerb/issues/1360)]

* **[Platform/Sessions]** Increased the possible length of IPs in sessions. The limit was previously 40 characters, but some IPv6 (e.g. IPv4 mapping) can be slightly longer. [[#1460](https://github.com/jstanden/cerb/issues/1460)]

* **[Automations/Mail]** Implemented the `mail.draft` automation event. Automations can modify any property on a new or resumed draft after a worker clicks on a 'Compose'  or 'Reply' button, but before the editor popup opens. Automations on this event are cumulative -- multiple automations can modify the draft, with subsequent changes on the same fields overwriting earlier ones. When setting `custom_fields:`, their `uri` field can be used as the key instead of IDs. New custom field changes are merged with existing fields. This event drastically simplifies workflows that modify drafts (e.g. always adding a `Bcc:` field). Previously, these workflows used 'Before composing/replying' behaviors, which required fragile Javascript.
  
* **[Automations/Mail]** Implemented the `mail.sent` automation event. Automations can perform actions after an outgoing message is sent by a worker.

* **[Mail]** Refactored mail sending functionality to generate content separately for every combination of saved/sent and html/text. For instance, a content modification can be targeted at only the 'sent html' part. Previously this was limited to saved/sent, but it couldn't target html/text.

* **[Mail/Markdown/UX]** When generating a plaintext body from a Markdown-formatted outgoing message, image tags with alt text are now properly matched and converted.

* **[Mail/Relays]** Inbound messages from workers through the email relay now generate a draft before being parsed. If the message fails to send (e.g. SMTP issues), it will remain a draft and retry rather than disappearing.

* **[Automations/Mail]** Implemented the `mail.send` automation event. Automations can modify sent message drafts before they are delivered. For instance, appending a unique survey link to only the sent+html message (not text, nor the copy Cerb saves), setting custom fields, or adding custom mail headers to prevent Sendgrid from rewriting the `Message-Id:` header. Content modifications can target any combination of text/html on the sent/saved message.

* **[Search/UX]** Search queries with unknown filters now return an error and no results. Previously, unknown filters were ignored, which could have unintentional effects.

* **[Custom Records/Performance]** On custom records, added an index to improve performance on filtering by the `name:` field. Some people use the name as a lookup field which could have >100K records. [[#1466](https://github.com/jstanden/cerb/issues/1466)]

* **[Records/Tickets/UX]** On ticket profiles, messages in the conversation now have a button to open their card rather than directly opening the editor. This makes it easier to see message links, view the full profile, etc.

* **[Records/Tickets/UX]** On ticket profiles, comments in the conversation now have a button to open their card rather than directly opening the editor. This makes it easier to see comment links, view the full profile, etc.

* **[Records/Tickets/UX]** On ticket profiles, drafts in the conversation now have a button to open their card rather than directly opening the editor. This makes it easier to see draft links, view the full profile, etc.

* **[Worklists/Subtotals]** In worklist subtotals, changed the default 'none' category to '(none)' to differentiate it from a literal value of 'none'.

* **[Worklists/Subtotals/Performance]** The subtotals sidebar on worklists now loads simultaneously (asynchronously). Previously, the worklist results and subtotals sidebar were calculated before any output was shown, which combined their max timeouts and could result in no output if the webserver hung up first (usually after 30 seconds). This also helps avoid the issue where a complex query prevents a worklist from finishing loading after closing and reopening.

* **[Worklists/Subtotals/Performance]** Fixed an issue where the worklist subtotals sidebar wasn't constrained by a query timeout. On a complex query, this could result in a backlog of database queries and a worklist that doesn't finish loading.

* **[Interactions/Await]** On `interaction.worker` automations, added an `await:duration:` continuation. This displays a `message:` and waits `until:` a given date/time or interval (e.g. `5 seconds`). This can be used to display a status update while waiting for a long-running asynchronous task to finish. For instance, an AWS Step Function for new account provisioning. [[#1455](https://github.com/jstanden/cerb/issues/1455)]

* **[Automations]** In automations, the `set:` command now substitutes placeholders sequentially rather than all at once. This means you can set a value in the first key and refer to that value in the second key. Previously this required two separate `set:` commands.

* **[Automations]** In automations, using the `http.request:` command, the `headers:` input now accepts either a string of newline-delimited header name/value pairs, or an array with header names as keys.

* **[Automations]** In automations, using the `http.request:` command, the `body:` now accepts either a string or an array. Arrays are automatically encoded to JSON (`application/json`) or YAML (`application/x-yaml`/`text/yaml`) with the appropriate `Content-Type:` header; and are otherwise URL-encoded (`application/x-www-form-urlencoded`). This removes the need for extraneous `set:` commands to prepare the HTTP request.

* **[Interactions]** On `interaction.worker` automations, when using an `await:form:` continuation, form elements may now include a custom `validation@raw:` option. Automation scripting can run logic and any output is considered to be an error message. The current element's value can be compared by using its placeholder name (e.g. `prompt_name`). Multiple conditions can be checked by using `if...elseif` logic.

* **[Interactions]** On `interaction.website` automations, when using an `await:form:` continuation, form elements may now include a custom `validation@raw:` option. Automation scripting can run logic and any output is considered to be an error message. The current element's value can be compared by using its placeholder name (e.g. `prompt_name`). Multiple conditions can be checked by using `if...elseif` logic.

* **[Interactions/Worker/UX]** In worker interactions, the search filter input is now more obvious in `sheet` elements on `await:form:` continuations. There is a magnifying glass icon with 'Search' placeholder text. Previously, during usability testing, several users thought the filter input was used to create new interactions rather than choose them.

* **[Automations/Errors]** Improved error reporting in automations when siblings of the same type have duplicate names; including those with the same type and no names. For instance, two sibling `set:` commands previously didn't return an error, but only the second one was evaluated. This also catches the issue where someone accidentally provides more than one `start:` command. [[#1462](https://github.com/jstanden/cerb/issues/1462)] [[#1463](https://github.com/jstanden/cerb/issues/1463)]

* **[Automations/UX]** In automations KATA, a new `@optional` key annotation is available. This removes a key if its value evaluates to blank. For instance, in a `record.update:` a set of `fields:` should only include those with new values. Previously this required logic for every optional field (usually an `outcome:` with a `var.set:`).

* **[Automations/Events]** In the Automation Events editor, when opening the automation chooser from the toolbar, it's now possible to create a new automation from
the sheet. Previously, this only displayed existing automations and new ones had to be non-intuitively created from Search->Automations.

* **[Automations/Events/UX]** In the `mail.received` automation event editor, the code editor toolbar now includes an option to generate an example auto-reply automation.

* **[Mail/Toolbars/Keyboard]** In the compose and reply editors, added configurable keyboard shortcuts for common toolbar items (e.g. bold, insert link, insert image). [[#1479](https://github.com/jstanden/cerb/issues/1479)]

* **[Mail/Downloads]** On messages on ticket profiles, in the '...' menu, there's a new 'Download all (.zip)' button when a message has attachments and the 'zip' PHP extension is installed/enabled. The button creates a single ZIP archive with the combined attachments and downloads it.

* **[Search/Timeouts]** Improved how timed out queries are canceled on the database server. Previously, the browser was properly displaying 'timed out', but the database server continued to run some queries. A new database connection is now used to terminate other threads.

* **[Search/Timeouts]** When a search query times out, the full query is now logged in the PHP error log, along with the database name, process ID, and timeout limit. Previously, the logged query was limited to the error log max line length default in PHP (usually 1024 characters).

* **[Worklists/Search/Performance]** In worklist search results, the total results are calculated in parallel with retrieving the current page of results. Previously, the count was calculated after the page of results was returned, which resulted in a longer wait. The result count has a shorter query timeout, and no longer blocks the page of results from being returned. In some environments, displaying an unfiltered total with millions of records can be slow with a cold cache. This no longer blocks a search popup from opening.
