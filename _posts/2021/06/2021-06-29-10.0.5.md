**Cerb (10.0.5)** is a **{{ page.release.type }}** in development as of {{page.date|date:'%B %d, %Y'}}. It includes **{{ page.release.count}}** minor features and fixes from community feedback covering the [10.0](/releases/10.0/) update.  You can [follow these instructions](/docs/upgrading/) to upgrade.

* **[Connected Accounts]** In connected account records, the 'URI' field now clearly allows dots. Thanks to [@mryanb](https://github.com/mryanb/) for reporting the inconsistency!

* **[Automations]** Fixed an issue in automations using the `log:` command, when the message used scripting and evaluated to a blank message. This was still returning an error for 'A log message is required.' when the command should have just been ignored.

* **[Tickets/Attachments]** Fixed an issue on ticket profiles for messages and comments. When opening the attachment menu, clicking on the 'Download' text did nothing, while clicking in whitespace in the same row did. [[#998](https://github.com/jstanden/cerb/issues/998)]

* **[Automations/Help]** In the Automation Event editor, the help link now properly points to the documentation.
