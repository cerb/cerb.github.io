**Cerb (10.0.4)** is a **{{ page.release.type }}** in development as of {{page.date|date:'%B %d, %Y'}}. It includes **{{ page.release.count}}** minor features and fixes from community feedback covering the [10.0](/releases/10.0/) update.  You can [follow these instructions](/docs/upgrading/) to upgrade.

* **[Toolbars/UI]** Fixed custom toolbar alignment issues on card popups.

* **[Toolbars/UI]** In custom toolbars, improved the style on split buttons above code editors to be consistent.

* **[Automations]** Fixed an issue with `text:type:bool` inputs in automations. A `default:yes` parameter always overwrote an explicit `false` value if `default@bool: yes` was used. The input was expecting text rather than a boolean. Thanks to [@mryanb](https://github.com/mryanb) for reporting.

* **[Records/Search]** Fixed an issue with record link filters when using the `recordLink.id:123` variation. The matching record label was only displayed if the record type had a `name` field. This now uses dictionaries for the uniform `_label` field. Thanks to [@mryanb](https://github.com/mryanb) for reporting.

* **[Records/Dictionaries/Custom Fields]** In record dictionaries, 'Record Link' custom field URIs now properly support key expansion. For instance, {% raw %}`{{ticket.testFieldset_recordLink__label}}`{% endraw %}. Thanks to [@mryanb](https://github.com/mryanb) for reporting.
