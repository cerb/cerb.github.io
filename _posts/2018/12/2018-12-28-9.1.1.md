It includes **{{ page.release.count}}** minor features and fixes from community feedback covering the [9.1](/releases/9.1/) update.  You can [follow these instructions](/docs/upgrading/) to upgrade.

* **[API]** Fixed an issue with key expansion in the API. [[#841](https://github.com/jstanden/cerb/issues/841)]

* **[Installer]** Added a test to the installer to make sure the MySQL version supports SPATIAL indexes. This catches cases where forks like MariaDB have different versioning. [[#843](https://github.com/jstanden/cerb/issues/843)]

* **[Updater]** Added a test to the updater to make sure the current MySQL version supports SPATIAL indexes. This catches cases where forks like MariaDB have different versioning. [[#843](https://github.com/jstanden/cerb/issues/843)]

* **[Bots/Scripting]** Fixed an issue in bot behavior scripts where temporary variables could overwrite placeholders of the same name. [[#842](https://github.com/jstanden/cerb/issues/842)]
