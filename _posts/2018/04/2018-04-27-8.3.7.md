**Cerb (8.3.7)** is a **{{ page.release.type }}** released on April 27, 2018. It includes **{{ page.release.count}}** minor features and fixes from community feedback covering the [8.3](/releases/8.3/) update.  You can [follow these instructions](/docs/upgrading/) to upgrade.

* **[Custom Records]** Fixed the `record_url` placeholder on custom records. This was creating URLs with a `/custom_record_X/` path rather than the configured record alias (e.g. `/issue/`, `/course/`). [[#670](https://github.com/jstanden/cerb/issues/670)]

* **[Project Boards/Custom Records]** Fixed an issue on project boards with custom record based cards. When dropping a card into a board column, behaviors for custom records were not triggering properly. [[#671](https://github.com/jstanden/cerb/issues/671)]

* **[Custom Records/Bots]** In custom behaviors on custom records, added the 'Create task' action. [[#672](https://github.com/jstanden/cerb/issues/672)]

* **[Custom Records/Bots]** In custom behaviors on custom records, added the 'Create notification' action.

* **[Custom Records/Bots]** In custom behaviors on custom records, added the 'Create ticket' action.

* **[Custom Records/Bots]** In custom behaviors on custom records, added the 'Send email' action.

* **[Platform/PHP]** Fixed a few more PHP 7.2 notices related to Countable objects.

* **[Profiles/Tasks]** On task profiles, added the `i` keyboard shortcut for the bot interactions menu.

* **[Records/Validation]** In record validation (create/update), the configured alias for a field is now used when returning errors about missing required values. This provides more useful errors in the API when the dictionary key and database schema differ on the naming of a field.

* **[Records/Contacts/Search]** Added a new `alias:` filter to search queries on contact records. For instance, `alias:[kina,milo]` could match 'Kina Halpue' and 'Milo Dade' by their aliases.

* **[Records/Orgs/Search]** Added a new `alias:` filter to search queries on organization records. For instance, `alias:[wgm,eff]` could match 'Webgroup Media LLC' and 'Electronic Frontier Foundation' by their aliases.

* **[Records/Workers/Search]** Added a new `alias:` filter to search queries on worker records. For instance, `alias:[kk,ed]` could match 'Karl Kwota' and 'Ned Flynn' by their aliases.
