**Cerb (8.3.5)** is a **{{ page.release.type }}** released on April 10, 2018. It includes **{{ page.release.count}}** minor features and fixes from community feedback covering the [8.3](/releases/8.3/) update.  You can [follow these instructions](/docs/upgrading/) to upgrade.

* **[Bots/Interactions]** Fixed an issue on the bot interaction chat window where a worker could `TAB` to the close button on accident and end the chat. [[#653](https://github.com/jstanden/cerb/issues/653)]

* **[API/Tickets/Split]** Tickets can now be split from the API using the `POST /rest/tickets/split.json` endpoint. A `message_id` parameter is required.

* **[API/Tickets/Merge]** Tickets can now be merged from the API using the `/rest/tickets/merge.json` endpoint. At least two `ticket_ids[]` parameters are required. For now, tickets are algorithmically merged into the oldest ticket. In the future, interactive merges will be supported.

* **[Records/Tickets/Merge]** When merging tickets, only one `-MERGED` suffix will now ever be added to the mask.

* **[Notifications]** Fixed an issue when clicking on a notification URL after the notification has been deleted. This was showing a blank white screen. [[#658](https://github.com/jstanden/cerb/issues/658)]

* **[Bots]** In bots, fixed an issue in ticket- and message-related behaviors. When setting a ticket owner, the `ticket_has_owner` placeholder wasn't updating during the same run of the behavior. Subsequent decisions that checked it could fail.

* **[Search/Elasticsearch]** When using Elasticsearch as the search engine for an index, we now properly support ES 6.x+ versions. They no longer allow more than one 'type' per index, nor contain the `_all` field.

* **[Bots/Simulator/HTTP]** Fixed an issue in bots with 'Execute HTTP Request' actions. If the request or response body contains binary content, the simulator output is no longer blank.

* **[Worklists/Watchers]** Fixed a PHP 7.2 'countable' warning on watcher buttons in worklists.
