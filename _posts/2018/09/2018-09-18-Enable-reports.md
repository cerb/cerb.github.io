You can use [dashboards](/docs/dashboards/) to build your own reports.  Cerb also ships with many built-in reports that you can access from a workspace page.

Click on the last item in the [navigation bar](/docs/navigation/) below the top left logo:

<div class="cerb-screenshot">
<img src="/assets/images/tips/enable-reports/navbar-add.png" class="screenshot">
</div>

Click on the **Help me create a page!** link:

<div class="cerb-screenshot">
<img src="/assets/images/tips/enable-reports/help-me.png" class="screenshot">
</div>

Select **Reports** and click the **Save Changes** button:

<div class="cerb-screenshot">
<img src="/assets/images/tips/enable-reports/wizard.png" class="screenshot">
</div>

You should now have a **Reports** page in your top navigation bar, that looks like:
