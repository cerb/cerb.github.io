You can use [dashboards](/docs/dashboards/) to build your own reports.  Cerb also ships with many built-in reports that you can access from a workspace page.

1. Click on the last item in the [navigation bar](/docs/guide/workers/user-interface/) below the top left logo:

	<div class="cerb-screenshot">
	<img src="/assets/images/tips/enable-reports/navbar-add.png" class="screenshot">
	</div>

1. Click on the **(+)** icon above the pages worklist.

1. Select **Reports** from the package library.

1. Click the **Create** button.

You should now have a **Reports** page in your top navigation bar, that looks like:

<div class="cerb-screenshot">
<img src="/assets/images/tips/enable-reports/reports.png" class="screenshot">
</div>
