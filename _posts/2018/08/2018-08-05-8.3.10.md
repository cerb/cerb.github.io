**Cerb (8.3.10)** is a **{{ page.release.type }}** released on August 5, 2018. It includes **{{ page.release.count}}** minor features and fixes from community feedback covering the [8.3](/releases/8.3/) update.  You can [follow these instructions](/docs/upgrading/) to upgrade.

* **[Custom Records/Owners]** Fixed an issue on custom records. When configuring a record type to only be "ownable by" groups or roles, the owner menu didn't show up when creating or editing those records.

* **[Worklists/Bulk/Ticket]** Fixed an issue on ticket worklists using bulk update. In some situations, a fulltext filter with many results (e.g. 5000+) could prevent the 'only checked' option of the bulk update from modifying the selected records.
