**Cerb (9.0.6)** is a **{{ page.release.type }}** released on {{page.date|date:'%B %d, %Y'}}. It includes **{{ page.release.count}}** minor features and fixes from community feedback covering the [9.0](/releases/9.0/) update.  You can [follow these instructions](/docs/upgrading/) to upgrade.

* **[Mail/Reply/UX]** Added a worker preference to control the behavior of email replies. By default in 9.x, replies open in a popup window. This allows the reply form to span multiple zones on a dashboard. The legacy reply behavior from 4.x->8.x is now available as an option, where the reply form opens below the quoted message within the conversation timeline. [[#719](https://github.com/jstanden/cerb/issues/719)]

* **[Mail/Reply]** Fixed an issue on the mail reply form where the watcher button only showed a count without a label. [[#771](https://github.com/jstanden/cerb/issues/771)]

* **[Data Queries/Custom Fields]** In data queries, fixed an issue with `type:worklist.metrics` and `type:worklist.series` queries when using custom fields for non-count aggregate functions (e.g. sum, avg, min, max).

* **[Worklists/Customize]** Fixed an issue when customizing worklists where legacy required filters couldn't be removed. [[#777](https://github.com/jstanden/cerb/issues/777)] [[#787](https://github.com/jstanden/cerb/issues/787)]

* **[Bots/Scripting]** In bot scripting, added `cerb_placeholders_list()` to the list of suggested functions in the autocompleter.

* **[Profiles/Tickets/UX]** On ticket profiles, moved the permalink button for messages to the top right toolbar. This is consistent with comments and can still be used when messages are collapsed.

* **[Worklists/Search]** In worklists, currency- and decimal-based custom fields are now available as filters in quick search. [[#789](https://github.com/jstanden/cerb/issues/789)]

* **[Data Queries/Metrics]** On `type:worklist.metrics` data queries, currency- and decimal-based custom fields are now computed properly with aggregate functions (e.g. sum, avg). [[#790](https://github.com/jstanden/cerb/issues/790)]
