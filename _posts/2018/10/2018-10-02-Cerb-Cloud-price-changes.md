We're simplifying the pricing of Cerb Cloud, and introducing optional enhanced support plans.

See: <https://cerb.ai/pricing/>

Effective November 1, 2018:

* Cerb Cloud subscriptions are **$30/seat-month (billed yearly)** or **$35/seat-month (billed monthly)**. Both prices are clearly displayed, rather than only showing the cheaper annual rate.

* **We are retiring all "grandfathered" rate discounts.**

* We removed the tiers (Startup/Corporate/Enterprise), minimum commitments, and initial discount for seats. These tiers have historically only affected services (e.g. support, infrastructure) and have never restricted features. The distinction was causing confusion.

* We will fully manage your infrastructure as needed, without extra costs, and without you having to determine for yourself when it's time for something esoteric like a dedicated database cluster with read replicas. We'll keep your instance of Cerb running smoothly, as your team size changes, and through traffic spikes (seasonal or otherwise).

* You can now optionally add a higher priority technical support plan (Corporate/Enterprise) to any existing subscription. These are billed on a monthly basis with no long-term commitments. For instance, you can engage priority support only when you have an urgent issue, when you want to tune up your workflows with a live hands-on team training session, or when building integrations. You don't need to pay extra in advance "just in case" you might need extra support.

* The scope, response time guarantees, and benefits of these new support plans are clearly defined. We now include live webinar assistance for building workflows, having real-time guided tours through new features, and for team training sessions with interactive Q&A. We've also added new autonomy-related benefits, like having access to temporary staging environments to test new upcoming functionality changes with a copy of your production data, and being able to schedule major upgrades at your own convenience.

* Priority support plans do have minimum commitments to ensure you have our full attention and the highest level of service in a sustainable way.

* For existing annual renewals that expire after November 1 2018, you will receive a pro-rated service credit when these new rates are less than what you paid. You will also receive the better of your current support agreement or the equivalent new plans.

Please [contact us](/help/) if you have any questions.

Thanks for using Cerb!
