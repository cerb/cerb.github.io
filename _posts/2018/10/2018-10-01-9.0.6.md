**Cerb (9.0.6)** is a **{{ page.release.type }}** in development as of October 1, 2018. It includes **{{ page.release.count}}** minor features and fixes from community feedback covering the [9.0](/releases/9.0/) update.  You can [follow these instructions](/docs/upgrading/) to upgrade.

* **[Mail/Reply/UX]** Added a worker preference to control the behavior of email replies. By default in 9.x, replies open in a popup window. This allows the reply form to span multiple zones on a dashboard. The legacy reply behavior from 4.x->8.x is now available as an option, where the reply form opens below the quoted message within the conversation timeline. [[#719](https://github.com/jstanden/cerb/issues/719)]

* **[Mail/Reply]** Fixed an issue on the mail reply form where the watcher button only showed a count without a label. [[#771](https://github.com/jstanden/cerb/issues/771)]

* **[Data Queries/Custom Fields]** In data queries, fixed an issue with `type:worklist.metrics` and `type:worklist.series` queries when using custom fields for non-count aggregate functions (e.g. sum, avg, min, max).
