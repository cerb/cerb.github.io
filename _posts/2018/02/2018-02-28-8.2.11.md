**Cerb (8.2.11)** is a **{{ page.release.type }}** released on February 28, 2018. It includes **{{ page.release.count}}** minor features and fixes from community feedback covering the [8.2](/releases/8.2/) update.  You can [follow these instructions](/docs/upgrading/) to upgrade.

* **[Platform/Sessions]** Fixed an issue that prevented sessions from workers with IPv6 addresses when MySQL was in strict mode. Thanks to [Thomas Gross](https://github.com/tgmedia-nz) for the report!

* **[Security/Attachments]** Fixed a possible self-XSS issue when uploading attachments. [[#604](https://github.com/jstanden/cerb/issues/604)]

* **[Security/Clickjacking]** Added `APP_SECURITY_FRAMEOPTIONS` to `framework.config.php` to control embedding in IFRAMEs and mitigate clickjacking. The options are `none` (no headers/protection) and `self` (only allow requests from within Cerb). The default is `self`. You can use `none` if you intend to implement the headers yourself (e.g. from the webserver). [[#605](https://github.com/jstanden/cerb/issues/605)]
