**Cerb (7.2.2)** is a **{{ page.release.type }}** released on August 26, 2016; it contains **{{ page.release.count }}** features, fixes, and usability enhancements from community feedback covering the [7.2](/releases/7.2/) update.  You can [follow these instructions](/docs/upgrading/) to upgrade.

* **[[CHD-4434]](https://wgmdev.atlassian.net/browse/CHD-4434) [Setup/Portals]** Fixed an issue where the community portal cache wasn't refreshing after a new portal was created.

* **[[CHD-4433]](https://wgmdev.atlassian.net/browse/CHD-4433) [Mail/Attachments]** Fixed an issue where non-members couldn't view the attachments of a public group.

* **[[CHD-4435]](https://wgmdev.atlassian.net/browse/CHD-4435) [Profiles/Links/Buckets]** Fixed an issue on the 'Links' tab of a profile. If specific buckets were linked to a record, the worklist didn't filter to only those linked buckets.

* **[Platform]** Fixed some compatibility issues with the latest versions of PHP7.

* **[Bots/Variables]** Fixed an issue in Virtual Attendants with the 'Set variable' action when using the quick search option. Editing the action wasn't showing the current value.

* **[Worklists/Tickets/Bulk]** Fixed an issue with bulk update on ticket worklists where the 'Move' option was being ignored.

* **[[CHD-4440]](https://wgmdev.atlassian.net/browse/CHD-4440) [Placeholders/Menus]** Fixed an issue with placeholder chooser menus where some custom field placeholders weren't listed. This occurred when a shorter placeholder wholly existed in the path of a longer placeholder.  For instance: "IT -> Department" and "IT -> Department -> Priority".  In this situation, the shorter placeholder was treated as only an expansion submenu for the longer placeholder. Now the shorter placeholder is both clickable and a submenu. The fact it is clickable is denoted by a bold label.

* **[[CHD-4437]](https://wgmdev.atlassian.net/browse/CHD-4437) [Worklists/Ticket]** Added a 'worker.replied:' quick search filter to ticket worklists. This returns tickets where any of the given workers wrote at least one outgoing message on the conversation.

* **[Worklists/Ticket]** Added a 'worker.commented:' quick search filter to ticket worklists. This returns tickets where any of the given workers wrote at least one comment on the conversation.

* **[Worklists/Messages]** Implemented the 'Ticket ID' filter on message worklists. This previously showed up in the filter list but didn't provide any options.

* **[[CHD-4436]](https://wgmdev.atlassian.net/browse/CHD-4436) [Worklists/Messages]** Message worklists can now be subtotaled by ticket ID or mask.

* **[[CHD-4442]](https://wgmdev.atlassian.net/browse/CHD-4442) [API/Comments]** Fixed a bug that prevented comments from being created properly through the REST API.

* **[[CHD-4432]](https://wgmdev.atlassian.net/browse/CHD-4432) [Worklists/Export]** When exporting a worklist, the configured fields on that record's card will be automatically selected as the defaults.

* **[[CHD-4377]](https://wgmdev.atlassian.net/browse/CHD-4377) [Web-API/Comments/Attachments]** In the REST API, 'expand=attachments' will return an array of attachments for comment objects.

* **[[CHD-4377]](https://wgmdev.atlassian.net/browse/CHD-4377) [Web-API/Messages/Attachments]** In the REST API, 'expand=attachments' will return an array of attachments for message objects.

* **[[CHD-4428]](https://wgmdev.atlassian.net/browse/CHD-4428) [Bots/Outcomes/Usability]** When editing a Virtual Attendant behavior outcome, the available conditions are now displayed in nested menus rather than a huge list. This makes it much faster and simpler to work with.

* **[[CHD-4428]](https://wgmdev.atlassian.net/browse/CHD-4428) [Bots/Actions/Usability]** When editing a Virtual Attendant behavior action, the available actions are now displayed in nested menus rather than a huge list. This makes it much faster and simpler to work with.

* **[Bots]** Fixed an issue where some custom field based outcomes weren't being tested properly if they were deeply nested.
