Cerb (7.2.1) is a maintenance update released on August 15, 2016; it contains 12 features, fixes, and usability enhancements from community feedback covering the recent 7.2 update.  You can [follow these instructions](/docs/upgrading/) to upgrade.

* **[Cards/Delete]** Fixed an issue with some card popups not refreshing their underlying worklist after deleting a record.

* **[[CHD-4417]](https://wgmdev.atlassian.net/browse/CHD-4417) [Cards/Opportunities]** Implemented card popups for opportunity records.

* **[[CHD-4344]](https://wgmdev.atlassian.net/browse/CHD-4344) [Setup/Workers/Usability]** Added quick search to the worklist on Setup->Workers.

* **[[CHD-4420]](https://wgmdev.atlassian.net/browse/CHD-4420) [Setup/Cards]** In Setup->Configure->Cards, there's now a 'Save Changes' button, since the auto-save was confusing users and leading them to believe nothing was happening.

* **[[CHD-4427]](https://wgmdev.atlassian.net/browse/CHD-4427) [Platform/Maint]** Completed bulk update batch records are now removed after 1 week during nightly maintenance.

* **[[CHD-1801]](https://wgmdev.atlassian.net/browse/CHD-1801) [Worklists/Orgs/Bulk]** Multiple organization records may be deleted using bulk update.

* **[[CHD-4275]](https://wgmdev.atlassian.net/browse/CHD-4275) [Worklists/Contacts/Bulk]** Multiple contact records may be deleted by admins using bulk update.

* **[Worklists/Tasks/Bulk/Usability]** When using bulk update on a task worklist, the desired actions are now selected with a checkbox before their options display. This simplifies the form and also allows for actions that don't have a 'blank' state (like a slider).

* **[[CHD-4426]](https://wgmdev.atlassian.net/browse/CHD-4426) [Worklists/Tasks/Bulk]** When using bulk update on a task worklist, the 'importance' field can now be set.

* **[Worklists/Tickets/Bulk/Usability]** When using bulk update on a ticket worklist, the desired actions are now selected with a checkbox before their options display. This simplifies the form and also allows for actions that don't have a 'blank' state (like a slider).

* **[[CHD-4426]](https://wgmdev.atlassian.net/browse/CHD-4426)** [Worklists/Tickets/Bulk] When using bulk update on a ticket worklist, the 'importance' field can now be set.

* **[Cards/Group/Bucket]** Fixed an issue on group and bucket cards where the ticket count buttons didn't filter their searches properly.
