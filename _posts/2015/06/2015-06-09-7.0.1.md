**Cerb ({{ page.title }})** is a **{{ page.release.type }}** released on {{ page.date | date: "%B %d, %Y" }}; it contains **{{ page.release.count }}** improvements from community feedback covering the [7.0](/releases/7.0/) update. You can [follow these instructions](/docs/upgrading/) to upgrade.

* **[[CHD-4096](http://wgmdev.atlassian.net/browse/CHD-4096)] [Mail/Parser/HTML]** An incoming message with a blank HTML part will no longer generate an original_message.html attachment. This includes messages that are only whitespace with no printable characters.

* **[[CHD-4107](http://wgmdev.atlassian.net/browse/CHD-4107)] [Worklists/Watchers/Recommendations/Usability]** When clicking on a button in the Watchers or Recommendations column of a worklist, holding SHIFT will toggle the status of the current worker without having to open the popup.

* **[[CHD-4105](http://wgmdev.atlassian.net/browse/CHD-4105)] [Groups/Responsibilities]** Adding a new bucket will now default member responsibility to neutral for all active group members. Previously, these initial responsibilities were all set to zero.

* **[[CHD-4104](http://wgmdev.atlassian.net/browse/CHD-4104)] [Worklists]** Fixed an issue where custom worklists that prevent worker sorting could still be sorted by using presets.

* **[[CHD-4090](http://wgmdev.atlassian.net/browse/CHD-4090)] [Mail/Relay]** Added an option to Setup->Mail->Relay to disable the relay functionality entirely. When disabled, all relay messages are treated as incoming messages on a conversation instead.

* **[[CHD-4086](http://wgmdev.atlassian.net/browse/CHD-4086)] [Mail/Parser]** Fixed an issue where some obscure mail attachments were being saved without a name (e.g. message/feedback-report).

* **[[CHD-4076](http://wgmdev.atlassian.net/browse/CHD-4076)] [Setup/Workers]** Fixed a duplicate query issue when assigning email addresses to workers in certain conditions.

* **[[CHD-3096](http://wgmdev.atlassian.net/browse/CHD-3096)] [Mail/Reply]** Implemented a new 'Reply to only these recipients' option to the Reply menu on ticket messages. This uses the literal To:/Cc: headers from the quoted message (much like 'reply to all') rather than the ticket recipients list. This includes the From: sender in the To: line, and automatically filters out Cerb-controlled reply-to addresses (e.g. support@, sales@) and excluded recipients.

* **[Notifications/Virtual Attendants]** Added a 'url' placeholder back to notification-based Virtual Attendant behaviors.

* **[[CHD-4119](http://wgmdev.atlassian.net/browse/CHD-4119)] [Mail/Profiles]** Fixed an issue where the 'read all' preference on ticket conversations wasn't being utilized properly.

* **[[CHD-4120](http://wgmdev.atlassian.net/browse/CHD-4120)] [Mail/Usability]** The order of the 'Recommended' and 'Watching' buttons is now consistent between worklists, profiles, and peek popups.

* **[[CHD-4084](http://wgmdev.atlassian.net/browse/CHD-4084)] [Virtual Attendants/Files]** In Virtual Attendant behaviors, the 'Send email' and 'Send email to recipients' actions can now attach files to outgoing messages using file bundles.
