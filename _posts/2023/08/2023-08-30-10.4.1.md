**Cerb (10.4.1)** is a **{{ page.release.type }}** released on {{page.date|date:'%B %d, %Y'}}. It includes **{{ page.release.count}}** minor features and fixes from community feedback covering the [10.4](/releases/10.4/) update.  You can [follow these instructions](/docs/upgrading/) to upgrade.

# Changelog

## Added

* **[Automations/Events]** The [record.changed](/docs/automations/triggers/record.changed/) automation event is now triggered when records are deleted. The event has a new `change_type` input with a value of `created`, `updated`, or `deleted`. For `created` the `was_record_*` dictionary is empty and `record_*` is the current state. For `deleted` the `was_record_*` and `record_*` are identical as the final state (this avoids existing listeners seeing deletion as changing every field value to blank). This behavior can be temporarily disabled with the `APP_OPT_RECORD_CHANGED_NO_DELETE` config option. Thanks to [1Password](https://1password.com/) for the feature request!

* **[Worklists/Toolbars]** A `records.worklist` [toolbar](/docs/toolbars/) can override the default explore mode by defining `interaction/explore:`.

* **[Profiles/Widgets]** On 'Interaction Toolbar' profile widgets, custom `keyboard:` shortcuts are now supported.

## Changed

* **[Worklists/Log]** On activity log worklists, the 'ID' column is now available.

* **[Records/Notifications]** On notification worklists, the record 'ID' column is now available.

* **[Records/Address]** On address cards and profile pages, the 'Record Fields' widget can now display the 'Worker' field.

* **[Records/Address]** On email address worklists, the 'Worker' column now displays the linked record rather than just a record ID.

* **[Interactions/UX]** The built-in `cerb.ticket.move` interaction now shows 50 groups/buckets per page rather than 10.

* **[Interactions/UX]** The built-in `cerb.ticket.assign` interaction now shows 25 workers per page rather than 10.

* **[Toolbars/KATA]** Toolbar editors now autocomplete the `keyboard:` option.

## Fixed

* **[Records/Notifications]** Fixed an issue with deleting notification records through the API or automations.

* **[Automations/Records]** Fixed a cache invalidation issue causing `record.changed` automation events to not trigger for custom field and custom fieldset records.

* **[Custom Records]** Fixed an issue that prevented custom record type class files to not be cleaned up on disk after deletion.

* **[Profiles/Merge]** Fixed an issue with the 'Merge' button at the top of profile pages for non-admins. Clicking the button had no effect due to a failing permissions check.

* **[Records/Search]** Fixed an issue with autocompletion on worklist search queries. The autocompletion suggestions menu closed prematurely after selecting a `filter:` from the menu.
