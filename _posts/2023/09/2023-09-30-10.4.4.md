## Changed

* **[Explore/Automations]** In `interaction.worker.explore` automations, custom toolbar interactions support `after:` options for `explore_page` and `refresh_widgets`. The former provides a default for the next page in the explore set when the interaction doesn't return one, which is useful when reusing built-in interactions like `cerb.ticket.status` or `cerb.ticket.move`. The latter can refresh widgets if the page is a record profile (for instance, refreshing 'Status' after closing a ticket). Thanks to [@myranb](https://github.com/mryanb/) for the feature request.

## Fixed

* **[Profiles/Widgets]** Fixed an issue with conditional profile widgets when using the `current_worker_` placeholders.

* **[Interactions/Worker]** Fixed an issue with `interaction.worker` automations that use `await:interaction:` to start another interaction. The interaction `caller_`, `client_`, and `worker_` placeholders weren't set properly.

* **[Comments]** Fixed an issue where comments didn't trigger @mention notifications from some record editors, or if using `#comment` when composing or replying to mail. This affected 10.4.x versions. It didn't affect the 'Comment' button on cards and profiles. [[#1743](https://github.com/jstanden/cerb/issues/1743)]
