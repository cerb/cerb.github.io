Here's a sneak peek at some new bot and dashboard features in Cerb 7.4. 

You can now build any kind of interactive survey (NPS, CSAT, CES) with conversational bots that chat with your users, and then track your results on bot-powered dashboards.

This entire workflow is built entirely in the browser with Cerb's own tools.
