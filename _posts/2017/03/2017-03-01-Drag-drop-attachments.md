When composing or replying to a message, you can drag files from your computer and drop them into the **Attachments** section. You'll see a green dashed outline to let you know that you're in the right place.

This is often much faster than using the chooser popup to locate files.

<div class="cerb-screenshot">
<img src="/assets/images/tips/drag-and-drop-attachments/drop.png" class="screenshot">
</div>

When the file finishes uploading you'll see a typical attachment:

<div class="cerb-screenshot">
<img src="/assets/images/tips/drag-and-drop-attachments/finished.png" class="screenshot">
</div>
