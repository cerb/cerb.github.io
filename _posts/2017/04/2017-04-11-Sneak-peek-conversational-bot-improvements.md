[Conversational bots](/guides/bots/conversational-bots/) can run complex automation behaviors in response to worker chat messages.

We've made the following improvements to conversational bots in the 7.4 update:

* **Message scripts**: Bots can send multiple messages in a row with a realistic delay and typing indicator. This makes conversations feel much more natural.

* **Prompts**: Bots can now prompt for different kinds of input.

* **Suggested responses**: When a bot is asking a closed-ended question, it can now suggest responses. A worker can click a suggestion rather than having to type.
