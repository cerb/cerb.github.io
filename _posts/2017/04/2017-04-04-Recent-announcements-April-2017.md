## The sneak peek

* [Kanban-style project boards with bot automation in 7.4](/blog/2017/04/04/Sneak-peek-at-project-boards/)

## The security notice

We strongly recommend that you upgrade to the latest version.

During one of our own security audits, we recently discovered a potential information leak that could be abused by a malicious worker under the right conditions.  We have no evidence that the vulnerability has ever been used.  It only affects a small number of self-hosted environments where common security practices already aren't being followed; but it would be possible back to 5.x versions.

If you use Cerb Cloud, we've already upgraded you.  Cerb Cloud wasn't vulnerable to this issue.

We believe in [responsible disclosure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsible_disclosure).  We will refrain from publishing any details about the potential vulnerability for a few weeks so that you have a chance to upgrade first.

Please [contact us](/contact/) if you require any assistance during the upgrade process.
