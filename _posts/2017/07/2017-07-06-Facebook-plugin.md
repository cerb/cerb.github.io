We just added a new [how-to guide](/resources/guides/) for [Configuring the Facebook plugin](/guides/integrations/facebook/). This allows you to automatically manage your Facebook pages from Cerb bots.

There's also a new [Facebook Page Bot](/packages/facebook-page-bot/) package with a working example.
