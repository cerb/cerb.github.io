When you reply to a message, Cerb quotes the original content by default. This is designed to make it easy for you trim a few relevant lines from the original message to give context to your response[^inline-replying].

However, many people just quote back your entire previous message in every response.

You can use the `#delete` command in a reply to quickly remove those huge blocks of quoted text.

For instance, in three keystrokes (`#`, `d`, and `<ENTER>`), you can turn this:

<div class="cerb-screenshot">
<img src="/assets/images/tips/quickly-delete-quoted-text/cut-quote.png" class="screenshot">
</div>

Into this:

<div class="cerb-screenshot">
<img src="/assets/images/tips/quickly-delete-quoted-text/cut-quote-post.png" class="screenshot">
</div>

That's much faster than holding `<SHIFT>` and pressing the `<DOWN>` arrow a few dozen times before pressing `<DELETE>`.

The same shortcut also works in the mobile interface, which saves a lot of time compared to trying to highlight a page of text with your fingers while simultaneously scrolling.
