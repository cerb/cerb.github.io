**Cerb (7.3.3)** is a **{{ page.release.type }}** in development as of February 18, 2017. It includes **{{ page.release.count}}** fixes and minor features from community feedback covering the [7.3](/releases/7.3/) update.  You can [follow these instructions](/docs/upgrading/) to upgrade.

* **[Tickets/Sticky Notes/Usability]** Fixed an issue with sticky notes on ticket profiles. When replying to a ticket, adding a sticky note or comment to a ticket refreshed the message and closed the reply form. New comments and messages are now inserted into the timeline dynamically so they don't interfere with other functionality.
