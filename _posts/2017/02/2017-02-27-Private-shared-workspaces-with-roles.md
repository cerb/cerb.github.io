When you create a [workspace](/docs/workspaces/) in Cerb, the owner determines who is able to use or modify it.

* **App-owned** workspaces can be used by everyone, but can only be modified by admins.
* **Role-owned** workspaces can be used by anyone in that role, but can only be modified by admins.
* **Group-owned** workspaces can be used by [group](/docs/groups/) members, but can only be modified by group managers.
* **Worker-owned** workspaces can only be used or modified by that [worker](/docs/workers/).

Sometimes you need to share a workspace with a few workers from different groups, while hiding it from everyone else. You can handle this with role-owned workspaces.

You'll need to be an admin to create a new role.

From the global [Search menu](/docs/getting-started/interface/#search-menu), select **Roles**.

Click the **(+)** icon above the worklist to add a new role.

Give a **Name:** to the new role.

In **Apply to:**, you can assign individual workers or entire groups.

For **Privileges** just select **None**.

Then click the **Save Changes** button.

Now from the **Search >> Workspace Pages** menu, you can use the new role as the owner when creating a new workspace or reassigning an existing one.
