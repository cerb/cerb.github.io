**Cerb (9.5.5)** is a **{{ page.release.type }}** released on {{page.date|date:'%B %d, %Y'}}. It includes **{{ page.release.count}}** minor features and fixes from community feedback covering the [9.5](/releases/9.5/) update.  You can [follow these instructions](/docs/upgrading/) to upgrade.

* **[Sheets]** On sheets, in `text` columns, fixed an issue with the `value_map:` option.

* **[Notifications/UX]** On notification worklists, fixed a usability issue with advancing past the last page. For instance, if a worker opened up notifications in browser tabs, the list could be shortened, and the 'next' page link was showing an empty list. Now when any non-first page is empty, the new last page of the list will be calculated and used instead. This also covers the refresh action. 

* **[Records/Workers/Cards]** On worker cards, fixed an issue with 'Mention Name' in 'Record Fields' widgets.

* **[Worklists/Search/UX]** On worklist search queries, improved the usability of the suggestions menu. Previously, the suggestions menu stole focus and automatically selected the first item, which could significantly interfere with typing -- especially on fulltext searches. Now, the menu is no longer focused when suggestions are made, and a selection must be made manually (with down arrow or the mouse). Otherwise, continued typing or the `RETURN` key will dismiss the menu. [[#1228](https://github.com/jstanden/cerb/issues/1228)]

* **[Plugins/Twitter]** Fixed an issue with replying to tweets from their card popup.
