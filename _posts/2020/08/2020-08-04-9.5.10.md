**Cerb (9.5.10)** is a **{{ page.release.type }}** in development as of {{page.date|date:'%B %d, %Y'}}. It includes **{{ page.release.count}}** minor features and fixes from community feedback covering the [9.5](/releases/9.5/) update.  You can [follow these instructions](/docs/upgrading/) to upgrade.

* **[Sheets]** Fixed a bug in sheets. When using a `date` column with a custom `format:` parameter, blank dates were displaying as the Unix epoch (1-Jan-1970 UTC). These are now always blank. Thanks to [@mryanb](https://github.com/mryanb) for the report.

* **[Records/API]** In the records API, when creating a `ticket` record, it's now possible to only set the `group_id` and have the default `bucket_id` discovered automatically. Previously it was possible to only provide a `bucket_id` and have the `group_id` auto-discovered.
