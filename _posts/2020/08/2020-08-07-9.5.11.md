**Cerb (9.5.11)** is a **{{ page.release.type }}** released on {{page.date|date:'%B %d, %Y'}}. It includes **{{ page.release.count}}** minor features and fixes from community feedback covering the [9.5](/releases/9.5/) update.  You can [follow these instructions](/docs/upgrading/) to upgrade.

* **[Portals/Bots/UX]** When configuring a 'Conversation Bot' portal, in the 'Security' section, the CORS URL now automatically trims any trailing slashes. Having a trailing slash can prevent the bot from working in browsers without an obvious cause. Thanks to [@abrenner](https://github.com/abrenner) for the suggestion!

* **[Records/Comments]** Fixed an issue with validation when creating comment records. The maximum comment length is 16,777,216 but was reported as 65,536 characters.

* **[Mail/Drafts]** When resuming a draft with an organization set, the recipients will be automatically suggested. This is particularly useful when creating a draft from an interaction on an org card.

* **[Bots/Behaviors]** When exporting a bot behavior, the `uri` field is now included. This makes it easier to build packages with interactions.

* **[Packages/Bots]** When importing packages with bots, behaviors may now include URIs. This makes it possible to import form interaction behaviors that are referenced by bundled interaction widgets.
