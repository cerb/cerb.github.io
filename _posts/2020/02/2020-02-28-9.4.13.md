**Cerb (9.4.13)** is a **{{ page.release.type }}** released on {{page.date|date:'%B %d, %Y'}}. It includes **{{ page.release.count}}** minor features and fixes from community feedback covering the [9.4](/releases/9.4/) update.  You can [follow these instructions](/docs/upgrading/) to upgrade.

* **[Platform/Security]** Hardened endpoints throughout Cerb based on an internal security audit.

* **[Portals/Support Center]** Fixed an issue in the Support Center that prevented users from updating permitted custom fields on the contact from their profile.

* **[Setup/Developers/Bots]** Added a new **Setup >> Developers >> Export Bots** page for administrators. Removed the same option in the `/debug` page.

* **[Mail]** Fixed an issue in mail signatures and templates that prevented images with `data:` URIs (of type `image/png`, `image/jpeg`, or `image/gif`).

* **[Profiles/Workers/Settings]** On worker profile settings, when saving the 'Profile' tab, a confirmation message is now properly shown.

* **[Records/Workspaces/Lists]** Fixed an issue where workspace lists couldn't be created directly from their worklist (opposed to a workspace tab, which is far more common).

* **[Profiles/Performance]** Optimized the loading of profile widgets with a cache per record type.

* **[Project Boards/UX]** Added an 'edit board' shortcut to the top right of project boards. This simplifies configuration when displaying project boards in dashboard widgets.

* **[Worklists/Tickets/Performance]** Optimized performance when exporting tickets from a worklist. Previously, this was inefficiently checking permissions for workers who weren't admins, which could time out when a worker was a member of many groups (the reporting case was in 49 groups). Now this uses the group roster cache for a more than 30X improvement in these cases.

* **[Security/Login]** A new session cookie is generated after a successful login.
