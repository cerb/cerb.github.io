**Cerb (9.5.2)** is a **{{ page.release.type }}** released on {{page.date|date:'%B %d, %Y'}}. It includes **{{ page.release.count}}** minor features and fixes from community feedback covering the [9.5](/releases/9.5/) update.  You can [follow these instructions](/docs/upgrading/) to upgrade.

* **[Platform/Popups/UX]** Fixed an issue with popups when there was no focusable element. A recent change stopped popups from focusing the close button, which in these situations also prevented the `<ESC>` button from quickly closing a popup. The popup itself is now focused.

* **[Bots/Behaviors]** Fixed an issue with importing bot behaviors that included 'disabled' or 'simulator' nodes. These options weren't being properly preserved. Thanks to [@beatbesmer](https://github.com/beatbesmer) and [@mryanb](https://github.com/mryanb) for the reports. [[#1245](https://github.com/jstanden/cerb/issues/1245)]

* **[Bots/Behaviors]** In bot behaviors, fixed an issue with the 'Schedule behavior' action where the "When should this behavior happen?" option stripped linefeeds in scripts to a single line. Thanks to [@mryanb](https://github.com/mryanb) for the report.

* **[Bots/Behaviors]** Fixed an issue with testing scripts in outcome nodes on bot behaviors.

* **[Cards/Usability]** When adding new email addresses from the popup editor, the 'Email:' field is now automatically focused for quicker data entry.

* **[Dashboards/Widgets/Form Interactions]** On 'form interaction' profile/workspace widgets, chooser prompts may now enable autocompletion. This allows workers to type a selection rather than using the chooser popup. Thanks to [@beatbesmer](https://github.com/beatbesmer) for the suggestion.

* **[Worklists/Bulk]** Fixed an issue with bulk update on worklists where certain events weren't triggering. For instance, status changes on tickets weren't adding activity log entries, nor setting the 'closed at' timestamp.

* **[Worklists/Tickets]** Fixed an issue on ticket worklists. Clicking the icon in the 'Spam training' column wasn't reporting spam.
