**Cerb (9.5.1)** is a **{{ page.release.type }}** released on {{page.date|date:'%B %d, %Y'}}. It includes **{{ page.release.count}}** minor features and fixes from community feedback covering the [9.5](/releases/9.5/) update.  You can [follow these instructions](/docs/upgrading/) to upgrade.

* **[Records/Knowledgebase/API]** Fixed an issue where the `content` key of knowledgebase article records had its URLs rewritten for the worker scope. This interfered with API usage.

* **[Bots/Behaviors]** Fixed an issue with drag re-ordering decision tree nodes in bot behaviors.

* **[Mail/Compose/Snippets]** Fixed an issue with inserting snippets in the mail compose popup.

* **[Platform/Login]** Unsupported browsers (e.g. Microsoft Internet Explorer) are now prevented from continuing on the login form. [[#1236](https://github.com/jstanden/cerb/issues/1236)]

* **[Data Queries]** Fixed an issue in the data query tester where `type:worklist.subtotals` queries returned an error when there was no data.

* **[Data Queries]** Fixed an issue in `type:worklist.subtotals` data queries when using `format:dictionaries`. If one of the `by:` columns was virtual (e.g. `actor` or `target` in activity log worklists) the record name and ID wasn't displayed in the output.

* **[Mail/HTML/Allowlist]** Fixed an issue with the links allowlist in HTML email. If the URL lacked a path or trailing slash, it never matched the allowlist.

* **[Mail/HTML/Links]** Fixed an issue with the anti-phishing confirmation popup in Firefox when clicking links in HTML email.

* **[Security/Login]** Fixed an open redirect on the login form. Outside of OAuth, a successful login now only redirects to paths within Cerb.

* **[Mail/Compose/Reply]** Fixed an issue when composing/replying that prevented `#attach` from suggesting the names of file bundles. [[#1232](https://github.com/jstanden/cerb/issues/1232)]

* **[Records/File Bundles]** On file bundle worklists, added a `usableBy.worker:` filter.

* **[Mail/Templates]** Fixed an issue with uploading images on mail template editors.

* **[Worklists/Tickets/UX]** On ticket worklists, dismissing the yellow 'undo' banner no longer refreshes the list.

* **[Records/Roles/Custom Fields]** When editing role records, custom fields are now managed above the itemized permissions. This saves the hassle of having to scroll down several pages to make changes.

* **[Mail/HTML/Images/Security]** When displaying HTML email, the image proxy may now be configured to cryptographically sign the URLs it creates. The built-in image proxy is only usable by worker accounts; but this is necessary if a third-party proxy handles these requests.

* **[Bots/Behaviors]** Bot behaviors can now use 'Record ID' variables as 'On:' targets. This simplifies actions like 'Run behavior' and 'Schedule behavior'. [[#1220](https://github.com/jstanden/cerb/issues/1220)]

* **[Platform/Popups/UX]** Improved the usability of popups by opening them immediately and showing a spinner until the content is loaded. Previously, the popup didn't open until the content was ready, which on slow connections could give the impression nothing was happening.

* **[Setup/Workers]** In Setup->Security->Authentication, it's now possible to set defaults for "Disable password-based authentication" and "Require multi-factor authentication" when creating new worker accounts. This makes it easier to enforce security policies.

* **[Platform/Popups/UX]** When popups encounter an error during loading (e.g. not found, forbidden, unauthenticated), they now display an error message. Previously, the popup was just blank.

* **[Setup/Security/UX]** In Setup, security-related settings have moved into a new 'Security' top-level menu.
