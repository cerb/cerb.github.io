**Cerb (9.6.4)** is a **{{ page.release.type }}** released on {{page.date|date:'%B %d, %Y'}}. It includes **{{ page.release.count}}** minor features and fixes from community feedback covering the [9.6](/releases/9.6/) update.  You can [follow these instructions](/docs/upgrading/) to upgrade.

* **[Bots/Scripting]** Added an `|indent(marker, fromLine)` filter to bot scripting. This indents each line in a block of text with the given marker. Optionally, markers may start at the given line. See: [indent](/docs/bots/scripting/filters/#indent)

* **[Bots/Scripting]** Added an `array_matches(values, patterns)` function to bot scripting. This returns any values that match at least one of the patterns (e.g. a set of `[support@cerb.example,sales@cerb.example]` could match the pattern `support@*` or `*@cerb.example`). See: [array_matches](/docs/bots/scripting/functions/#array_matches)

* **[Activity Log/Localization]** Fixed an issue in the activity log, where a translation didn't exist for the `record.delete` event. 

* **[Bots/Scripting]** In bot scripting, added a `|csv` filter for formatting an array as a comma-separated values list. This is useful for exporting reports for Excel from bots. See: [csv](/docs/bots/scripting/filters/#csv)

* **[Bots/Scripting]** In bot scripting, added an `array_extract_keys()` function. This filters list of arrays or objects to only include the given keys. This is useful to extract certain keys from a list of dictionaries (e.g. data query results). See: [array_extract_keys](/docs/bots/scripting/functions/#array_extract_keys)

* **[Records/Tickets/Bulk]** On ticket worklists, when using bulk update, a new "Don't modify the updated timestamp" option is available. Thanks to [1Password](https://1password.com/) for the request!

* **[Bot/Behaviors/Mail]** Fixed an issue with 'Message added to ticket' events where a 'Move to' action in one behavior wasn't reflected in a lower priority behavior that ran afterwards.
