**Cerb (9.6.5)** is a **{{ page.release.type }}** released on {{page.date|date:'%B %d, %Y'}}. It includes **{{ page.release.count}}** minor features and fixes from community feedback covering the [9.6](/releases/9.6/) update.  You can [follow these instructions](/docs/upgrading/) to upgrade.

* **[Records/Attachments]** Fixed an issue where attachments on custom records weren't visible by non-admins.

* **[Bots/Records]** In bot behaviors, fixed an issue with conditions on the 'phone' and 'mobile' fields on org and worker records.

* **[Logins/UX]** When clicking a link with a search query and no session, the query will now be properly preserved through the login process.

* **[Records/Validation]** In the validation service, fixed an issue when non-string data was formatted in a string field.

* **[Comments/UX]** When composing, replying, or commenting, the `@mentions` autocomplete menu now properly allows selection with `<tab>`. Previously using `<tab>` selected from the menu but then advanced to the next field. Thanks to [1Password](https://1password.com/) for the report! [[#1325](https://github.com/jstanden/cerb/issues/1325)]
 
* **[Mail/SMTP/OAuth]** Mail transports can now use XOAUTH2 authentication for SMTP connections. This uses a linked OAuth2 connected account (e.g. Gmail, Microsoft O365). Many larger email providers are requiring OAuth2 authentication and retiring legacy passwords.

* **[Setup/Developers/Data Queries]** In Setup->Developers->Data Query Tester, comments are now allowed with the bot scripting `{# ... #}` syntax.

* **[Bots/Custom Records/Notifications]** Fixed an issue in bot behaviors when generating notification permalinks to custom records. This generated URLs like `/profiles/custom_record/` rather than `/profiles/{record_name}/`. Thanks to [@mryanb](https://github.com/mryanb) for reporting.
