**Cerb (9.6.6)** is a **{{ page.release.type }}** released on {{page.date|date:'%B %d, %Y'}}. It includes **{{ page.release.count}}** minor features and fixes from community feedback covering the [9.6](/releases/9.6/) update.  You can [follow these instructions](/docs/upgrading/) to upgrade.

* **[Custom Records/Search]** Fixed an issue with autocompletion in custom record search queries where faceted filters like `owner.worker:` weren't being suggested. Thanks to [@mryanb](https://github.com/mryanb) for reporting. [[#1396](https://github.com/jstanden/cerb/issues/1396)]

* **[Email Signatures/Search]** Fixed an issue with autocompletion in email signature search queries where faceted filters like `owner.worker:` weren't being suggested.

* **[Validation]** Fixed an issue with some string validation where null values were disallowed. This affected the 'DOB' field on contacts, etc. Thanks to [@mryanb](https://github.com/mryanb) for reporting.

* **[Mail/Reply]** In the reply editor, added a `Ctrl+Shift+L` shortcut for condensing double spaced lines to single spacing.

* **[Profiles/Tickets/Usability]** On ticket profiles, in the 'Conversation' widget, quoted lines with blank spaces between them are now properly collapsed into a single '-show quote-' block. Thanks to [Flexibits](https://flexibits.com/) for the suggestion.

* **[Worklists/Tickets/Usability]** On ticket worklists, when subtotaling by bucket, the non-selected bucket totals remain visible to simplify switching between them. If more than one bucket is selected by a filter, the subtotal list will be constrained to only those. Thanks to [1Password](https://1password.com/) for the suggestion. [[#1397](https://github.com/jstanden/cerb/issues/1397)]

* **[Records/Contact/Chooser]** Fixed an issue when creating contacts and orgs at the same time. If editing an email address record, then creating a contact, and creating an org from the contact, two bubbles were added to the email address 'Contact:' field (an extra for the organization). Thanks to [@mryanb](https://github.com/mryanb) for reporting. [[#1401](https://github.com/jstanden/cerb/issues/1401)]
