**Cerb (9.5.9)** is a **{{ page.release.type }}** in development as of {{page.date|date:'%B %d, %Y'}}. It includes **{{ page.release.count}}** minor features and fixes from community feedback covering the [9.5](/releases/9.5/) update.  You can [follow these instructions](/docs/upgrading/) to upgrade.

* **[Classifiers]** Fixed an issue with classifier training examples that contained HTML tags. These were not being properly escaped when labeling.

* **[Form Interactions/UX]** In form interaction behaviors, when using the 'Prompt with record chooser' action with the 'worker' record type, the 'me' shortcut is now displayed for quick selection by the current worker.

* **[Records/Logs]** Fixed an issue with logging deletions in the activity log on 'email template' records.

* **[Mail/Attachments]** Fixed an issue with 'message/rfc822' attachments (`.eml`) sent from Cerb. Some clients reported these were blank when opened in Outlook. By default, attachments are base64-encoded, but this is not allowed by the RFC-2822 for attached messages. As a workaround, we save these attachments as `application/octet-stream` so the receiving email client can make a decision based on the file extension instead. This worked when testing in Outlook and Thunderbird. Ideally we would treat `message/rfc822` attachments as text, but this requires upstream changes to the Swiftmailer library.

* **[Records/Subtotals/UX]** On the worklist subtotals sidebar, increased the truncation threshold from 25 characters to 32. This shows a bit more of a long record name before adding "`...`".
