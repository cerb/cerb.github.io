**Cerb (9.6.7)** is a **{{ page.release.type }}** released on {{page.date|date:'%B %d, %Y'}}. It includes **{{ page.release.count}}** minor features and fixes from community feedback covering the [9.6](/releases/9.6/) update.  You can [follow these instructions](/docs/upgrading/) to upgrade.

* **[Bots/Scripting]** In bot scripting, added an `|image_info` filter. This returns information about an image file (e.g. width, height, bits/channels, MIME type). The input can be bytes or a base64-encoded data URI string. This is useful for error checking images from behaviors before updating records.

* **[Bots/Scripting]** In bot scripting, added an `array_sum()` function to sum the numeric elements of an array and return the total.

* **[Bots/Scripting]** In bot scripting, added a `clamp_float()` function for setting the range boundaries of a decimal number.

* **[Bots/Scripting]** In bot scripting, added a `clamp_int()` function for setting the range boundaries of an integer number.

* **[Worklists/Bulk]** Fixed an issue with bulk update on worklists. If a worker lacked edit permission on all of the selected records, it was possible for the bulk update to endlessly iterate without changing anything (e.g. "Updating 100 of 0").

* **[Custom Records/Search]** Fixed an issue with custom record types when using the 'Hide from search menu' option. This was also preventing that record type from being used in profile tabs, search buttons in 'Record Fields' widgets, etc. Thanks to [@mryanb](https://github.com/mryanb) for reporting.
