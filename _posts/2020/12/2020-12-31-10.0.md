# Sheets

See: [Sheets](/docs/sheets/)

### Sheet row selection

Sheets now include a `selection:` column type. This is used by widgets and [interactions](/docs/interactions/) to use sheets as a prompt for selecting one or more records. The selection key can be any arbitrary value; or even a compound key, or JSON object.

For instance, on a ticket profile, a sheet widget can display the current 'Participants', and rows can be selected in combination with a 'Remove' interaction.

Over time this will replace the "choosers" feature. Unlike choosers, sheets aren't limited to displaying records, and can display any data within a dictionary (e.g. hard-coded options, dynamic API results, etc).

### Interaction toolbars on sheets

On card, profile, and workspace sheet widgets, an [interaction](/docs/interactions/)-powered [toolbar](/docs/interactions/toolbars/) may now be included with buttons that change depending on the selected rows.

New rows can be added to a sheet from its toolbar. [[#959](https://github.com/jstanden/cerb/issues/959)]

### Grid layout

Implemented a new sheet `layout:style:` of `grid`. This displays a compact grid rather than a table. For instance, this is used when selecting an icon in some interactions.

### Sheet filtering

Added a new `layout:filtering@bool:` option to sheets. When enabled, this shows a search box above the list to filter the current results.

# Project Boards

See: [Project Boards](/docs/project-boards/)

### Card content from automations

The content of cards is determined by an [automation](/docs/automations/) on the `projectBoard.renderCard` trigger, which can be provided per-columm, or globally (default for all columns) on the board itself. The automation must return a sheet schema to display.

### Column toolbars

Project board columns can now display a [toolbar](/docs/interactions/toolbars/) of custom [interactions](/docs/interactions/) (e.g. add task), and may provide one or more automations on the `projectBoard.cardAction` trigger (in event handler KATA) to run when a card transitions to a new column.

Default [automations](/docs/automations/) are provided for adding tasks, rendering task cards, and rendering completed tasks.

Existing card action behaviors are deprecated and are migrated to the [event handler](/docs/automations/#event-handlers) KATA.

# Data Queries

Added new data query types:

|Type |Description
|:-|:-
| [**platform.extensions**](/docs/data-queries/platform/extensions/) | Get a filterable/pageable list of plugin extensions for a given [point](/docs/plugins/extensions/#extension-points).
| [**record.field**](/docs/data-queries/record/fields/) | Get a filterable/pageable list of fields on a given [record type](/docs/records/types/).
| [**record.types**](/docs/data-queries/record/types/) | Get a filterable/pageable list of [record type](/docs/records/types/).
| [**ui.icons**](/docs/data-queries/ui/icons/) | Get a filterable/pageable list of the 600+ built-in icons.

# Records

### Attachments

* In attachment record dictionaries, added a `download_url` placeholder for the download link.

### Connected Accounts

* On connected account records, added a `uri` field. This is a unique identifier (letters, numbers, dashes) used by other functionality (like automations) to refer to a connected account without using internal IDs.

### Custom Fields

* Custom field records must now define a unique nickname (URI). This is used by functionality like the API, queries, and records API to show human-readable custom field names, where previously they were unhelpfully named using their IDs, like `custom_123`. Existing custom fields are automatically assigned URIs by the update.

* When expanding record dictionaries, the `custom` expansion key continues to return ID-based field names, like `custom_123`. The new `customfields` expansion key returns URI-based custom field names for human readability.

### Reminders

* Reminder records now use [event handler](/docs/automations/event-handler/) KATA to trigger any number of [automations](/docs/automations/) when the alert timer has elapsed. For instance, the reminder worker receive a notification, email, SMS message, etc.

### Tickets

* On ticket profiles, the 'Participants' widget now provides shortcut [interactions](/docs/interactions/) for 'add' and 'remove'.

### Webhooks

* Refactored webhook listeners to use [automations](/docs/automations/) rather than behaviors. Automations on the `webhook.respond` trigger can be provided in event handler KATA. The input includes details about the HTTP request, and output controls the HTTP response. Webhook listener extensions have been retired (behavior was the only option). Existing webhook behaviors are deprecated and are automatically migrated to the new event handler KATA.

# Platform

### Installer

* When installing a new instance of Cerb, a snapshot is now used to initialize the database rather than running all of the patches since 4.0. This is much faster, which improves the user experience, as well as speeding up automated tests, Docker images, etc. [[#109](https://github.com/jstanden/cerb/issues/109)]

### Deprecated and retired features

* Retired message toolbar extensions. These can be better implemented with [interactions](/docs/interactions/) now.

* Conversational bot behaviors on the "global" interaction point (the round floating Cerb icon the lower right) are now moved into a '(Deprecated Behaviors)' sub-menu. These workflows should be migrated to automations.
