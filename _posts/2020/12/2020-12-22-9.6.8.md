**Cerb (9.6.8)** is a **{{ page.release.type }}** released on {{page.date|date:'%B %d, %Y'}}. It includes **{{ page.release.count}}** minor features and fixes from community feedback covering the [9.6](/releases/9.6/) update.  You can [follow these instructions](/docs/upgrading/) to upgrade.

* **[Mail/Parser/Tickets]** Fixed an issue with inbound mail participants. When the 'Automatically include To/Cc recipients' option was enabled (Setup->Mail->Incoming->Settings), other recipients were not being added as participants. This issue was introduced in 9.6 after removing the dependency on ext/imap. [[#1412](https://github.com/jstanden/cerb/issues/1412)]

* **[Localization/Mail]** Improved the rendering of right-to-left languages (e.g. Hebrew, Arabic) in messages, comments, drafts, and knowledgebase articles. This text was being left-justified instead of right-justified.

* **[Mail/PGP]** Fixed an issue with sending PGP email to a public key recipient when the UID email address contains mixed cases. Cerb normalizes email addresses to lowercase, but the comparison for PGP wasn't doing so. Thanks to [Cr√©dit Agricole SA](https://www.credit-agricole.com/) for the report!
