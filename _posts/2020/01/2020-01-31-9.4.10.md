**Cerb (9.4.10)** is a **{{ page.release.type }}** released on {{page.date|date:'%B %d, %Y'}}. It includes **{{ page.release.count}}** minor features and fixes from community feedback covering the [9.4](/releases/9.4/) update.  You can [follow these instructions](/docs/upgrading/) to upgrade.

* **[Records/Comments]** Fixed an issue with dropping or pasting files in the inline 'Comment:' option on record editors. This wasn't linking attachments to the current record. This didn't affect the normal comment editor. [[#1170](https://github.com/jstanden/cerb/issues/1170)]

* **[Records/Links]** It's now possible to search records for `links:no` (none) or `links:yes` (any). Previously, expressions that didn't match a record type were claiming "There are no links", but results weren't actually filtered. [[#1172](https://github.com/jstanden/cerb/issues/1172)]

* **[Records/Links]** It's now possible to search attachment records for `on:none` or `on:any`. Previously, expressions that didn't match a record type were claiming "There are no attachment links", but results weren't actually filtered. [[#1171](https://github.com/jstanden/cerb/issues/1171)]

* **[Cards/Widgets]** Fixed an issue with the placeholder tester on card widgets.

* **[Platform/PHP]** Fixed various notices and deprecation warnings for PHP 7.4 compatibility. However, bot scripting remains non-compatible with PHP 7.4 until Cerb 9.5.
