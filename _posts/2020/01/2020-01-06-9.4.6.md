**Cerb (9.4.6)** is a **{{ page.release.type }}** released on {{page.date|date:'%B %d, %Y'}}. It includes **{{ page.release.count}}** minor features and fixes from community feedback covering the [9.4](/releases/9.4/) update.  You can [follow these instructions](/docs/upgrading/) to upgrade.

* **[Mail/Reply/Compose]** When composing and replying, fixed the autocomplete shortcut of `Ctrl+Space` so it doesn't trigger on `Ctrl+Cmd+Space` -- the emoji picker shortcut in macOS/Safari. [[#1125](https://github.com/jstanden/cerb/issues/1125)]

* **[Mail/Reply/Custom Fields]** Fixed an issue when replying. Changes to a multi-checkbox custom field weren't being saved. This had to do with validation checking against possible values but not ignoring the leading `+` or `-` for the delta set/unset. [[#1124](https://github.com/jstanden/cerb/issues/1124)]

* **[Mail/Comments]** Fixed an issue with `@mention` autocompletion suggestions when composing, replying, and commenting. Suggestions were being generated based on just the full name and not the mention nickname. Both are now considered. [[#1126](https://github.com/jstanden/cerb/issues/1126)]

* **[Mail/Reply]** Fixed an issue when replying to mail where the 'Save without sending' option could disobediently still send a message. [[#1127](https://github.com/jstanden/cerb/issues/1127)]

* **[Worklists/Import]** On worklists, the CSV import option can now properly set multi-checkbox custom fields. Multiple word options can be wrapped in escaped quotes (e.g. `\"Multiple Words\"`). New options are added to the existing options. Options can be prefixed with `-` (dash) to unset them on existing records.

* **[Worklists/Bulk/Broadcast]** When broadcasting from supported worklists (e.g. email addresses, contacts, orgs), the 'From:' is now a group/bucket rather than just a group. This allows finer-grained control over the sender address, signature, and layout/template. [[#1130](https://github.com/jstanden/cerb/issues/1130)]

* **[Mail/Scheduled/Bots]** 'Before sending message' bot behaviors can now override the 'Send at' option on outgoing replies. This can enforce a scheduled delivery review period for certain classes or workers (e.g. interns), or in certain cohorts (e.g. group/bucket). [[#1128](https://github.com/jstanden/cerb/issues/1128)]

* **[Records/Tickets/Usability]** On ticket worklists, a 'Participants' column can now be added. This displays up to three participants as card popup links, with an "and (n) others" search link popup if there are more. [[#1129](https://github.com/jstanden/cerb/issues/1129)]
