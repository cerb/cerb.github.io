**Cerb (9.3.6)** is a **{{ page.release.type }}** released on {{page.date|date:'%B %d, %Y'}}. It includes **{{ page.release.count}}** minor features and fixes from community feedback covering the [9.3](/releases/9.3/) update.  You can [follow these instructions](/docs/upgrading/) to upgrade.

* **[Search/Data Queries]** Implemented autocompletion for calendar name filters in search/data queries.

* **[Search/Data Queries]** Implemented autocompletion for classifier name filters in search/data queries.

* **[Custom Fields/Database]** Fixed an issue in custom fields when database query read/write splitting is enabled. Some `DELETE` queries were being sent to replica/slave, which would fail in read-only mode.

* **[Records/Bulk/Database]** Fixed an issue with bulk updating a worklist when database query read/write splitting is enabled.

* **[Bots/Behaviors]** Fixed an issue with the 'Run behavior' action in bot behaviors. It was possible to target non-triggerable behaviors (e.g. interactions), which ungracefully logged a PHP error. Thanks to [Beat Stieger](https://github.com/beatbesmer) for the report.

* **[Cards/Editors/UX]** Fixed an issue on card editor popups. When rapidly clicking the 'Save Changes' button, it was possible for the error banner to gradually move down from the top of the screen. Anything above that point was no longer clickable, even when the alert was dismissed. Often this was observed as an inability to drag the popup window.

* **[Records/Workspace Pages]** On workspace page worklists, added a `fieldset:` filter. 

* **[Records/Workspace Pages]** On workspace page worklists, it is now possible to subtotal by fieldset.

* **[Records/Behaviors/Cards]** On behavior cards, the order of the toolbar is now consistent with other records.
