**Cerb (9.1.3)** is a **{{ page.release.type }}** in development as of {{page.date|date:'%B %d, %Y'}}. It includes **{{ page.release.count}}** minor features and fixes from community feedback covering the [9.1](/releases/9.1/) update.  You can [follow these instructions](/docs/upgrading/) to upgrade.

* **[Dashboards/Filters]** On dashboards, pressing `<RETURN>` in a date filter textbox will update the dashboard. Additionally, clicking a date filter preset now focuses the cursor into the text box. Previously you had to click the 'Update' button. [[#784](https://github.com/jstanden/cerb/issues/784)]

* **[Platform/Database]** Fixed an issue with the database service that prevented MySQL error codes from being logged properly.

* **[Tickets/Merged]** When merging tickets, fixed a failing database query when the project boards plugin isn't installed or enabled.

* **[Extras/ImpEx]** Updated the `cerb-package-exporter.php` script to also export time tracking entries and their comments when linked to tickets.

* **[Workspaces/Worklists]** Fixed an issue when copying worklists. The required query wasn't being copied.

* **[Dashboards/Filters]** On dashboards filters, added a new `multiple: true` option to picklist filters. This allows the selection of multiple options from a checkbox menu rather than a single selection from a dropdown list. The value is an array of the selected options. [[#846](https://github.com/jstanden/cerb/issues/846)]

* **[Plugins/JIRA]** In JIRA issue records, the 'Status' and 'Type' fields are now stored as text. Previously these were IDs based on id/label pairs in the parent JIRA project record. This makes working with the records API easier, and it makes synchronization more efficient.
