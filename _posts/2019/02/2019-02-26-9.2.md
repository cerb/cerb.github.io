# Package Library

The main limitation of [packages](/docs/packages/) has been that only administrators can use them. Many teams have asked for a way to more broadly use packages to automate workflows that involve the creation of records.

A new **package library** solves this issue by allowing workers to make selections from a list of pre-approved templates that are curated by administrators. We've provided many useful defaults, and admins can add new packages based on the specific needs of their team.

The package library is organized into sections (i.e. extension points) that determine where specific packages are available -- when creating a new project board, adding widgets to a dashboard, etc.

Packages can save a lot of time by creating multiple related records at once. For example, when creating a new project board in one-click using the 'Kanban' template, a board is created with three columns (TODO, In Progress, and Completed), along with the automation to close tasks when moved into the completed column. Previously, all of these elements had to be created and configured individually.

Packages in the library may also contain prompts that gather input from workers to customize each use -- targeting a specific worker, providing a name, selecting a date range, etc.

The library drastically simplifies some workflows that are currently being done with bot interactions. For instance, creating a chain of related tasks on a ticket as a single action. These options are now available in the standard **(+)** popup editor when creating records.

Administrators can manage the package library from **Setup >> Packages >> Library** or from **Search >> Packages**.

### Bot Behavior Library

# Roles

### Automatic role membership with queries

Simplified role management for large or frequently changing teams. Membership in a particular role is now determined using a search query that matches the desired worker records.

For instance, an "Administrator" role may define membership as `isAdmin:yes`, and its roster will automatically update to always include every worker with administrator privileges. Previously workers had to be assigned to roles manually. The members of a role are granted its privileges.

<div class="cerb-screenshot">
<img src="/assets/images/releases/9.2/roles-membership-queries.png" class="screenshot">
</div>

### Define read and write access for role-owned records

Roles are now much more flexible about who can view and edit their owned records. [[#883](https://github.com/jstanden/cerb/issues/883)]

Previously, role-owned records were readable by all members of the role and editable only by admins. This left groups as the only way to share edit privileges on a record.

Now, when creating or editing a role, two new options are available for "Records owned by this role are visible to these workers" and "Records owned by this role can be edited by these workers". Like the membership improvement, these options provide a search query to determine which workers may view or edit the role's records. The editors and users of role-owned content are no longer required to members of that role.

<div class="cerb-screenshot">
<img src="/assets/images/releases/9.2/roles-ownership-queries.png" class="screenshot">
</div>

### Deep search roles from worker records

On worker worklists, new `role.editor:` and `role.reader:` deep-search filters make it easy to segment workers by the ability to respectively edit or use role-owned records.

<div class="cerb-screenshot">
<img src="/assets/images/releases/9.2/roles-deep-search-from-workers.png" class="screenshot">
</div>

### Deep search workers from role records

On role worklists, there are new deep-search filters for `member:`, `editor:`, and `reader:`. These find roles with matching workers who are granted role privileges (members), able to edit role-owned records (editors), or able to read/use role-owned records (readers).

<div class="cerb-screenshot">
<img src="/assets/images/releases/9.2/roles-deep-search-of-workers.png" class="screenshot">
</div>

### Profile images for roles

Added profile pictures to role records. These are displayed on cards, worklists, and profile pages.

# Workspaces

### Owners are displayed on workspace pages

Workspaces now display their owner in the top right of the page. Clicking on that name opens their card. For roles, this makes it easy to see who the editors are.

<div class="cerb-screenshot">

</div>

# Dashboards

### Click to search on subtotal-based categories charts

On 'Chart: Categories' dashboard widgets using a `worklist.subtotals` data query, clicking on a bar segment will open a search worklist automatically filtered to the underlying records.

### Click to search on subtotal-based pie charts

On 'Chart: Pie' dashboard widgets using a `worklist.subtotals` data query, clicking on a segment or legend label will open a search worklist automatically filtered to the underlying records. [[#896](https://github.com/jstanden/cerb/issues/896)]

<div class="cerb-screenshot">
<img src="/assets/images/releases/9.2/dashboards-pie-search.gif" class="screenshot">
</div>

### Click to search on subtotal-based time series charts

On 'Chart: Time Series' dashboard widgets using a `worklist.subtotals` data query, clicking on a data point will open a search worklist automatically filtered to the underlying records. [[#898](https://github.com/jstanden/cerb/issues/898)]

### Category charts in background tabs

Fixed an issue with dashboards where 'Categories' widgets didn't load properly when opened in a new background tab in the browser. [[#731](https://github.com/jstanden/cerb/issues/731)]

# Packages

### Picklist prompts in packages

Packages now support a 'picklist' prompt type, which allows the user to select from a pre-defined list of options.

<div class="cerb-screenshot">
<img src="/assets/images/releases/9.2/packages-prompts-picklist.png" class="screenshot">
</div>

### Import nodes on existing behaviors with packages

In packages, behavior nodes (e.g. decision, action, loop) can be added to an existing behavior. Previously, it was only possible to add entire behaviors.

### Dynamic parent bot in behavior packages

In packages, the `bot_id` of a `behaviors` record can now be specified using placeholders.

### Packages menu in setup

Packages now have their own menu in **Setup >> Packages**. This includes the packages library and the ability to import arbitrary packages (previously **Setup >> Configure >> Import Package**).

# Project Boards

### Default task status action on project boards

On project boards, a built-in action is now available for automatically changing task statuses (e.g. completed) when cards are dropped on the column. Previously this very common workflow had to be implemented using bot behaviors, which added unnecessary complexity.

<div class="cerb-screenshot">
<img src="/assets/images/releases/9.2/project-board-task-status-action.png" class="screenshot">
</div>

# Records

## Emoji support

<div class="cerb-screenshot">
<img src="/assets/images/releases/9.2/records-comments-emoji.png" class="screenshot">
</div>

Cerb now uses 'utf8mb4' (4-byte UTF-8) encoding for the database connection. This is backwards compatible with the 3-byte 'utf8' encoding we've used historically, while allowing us to begin transitioning the schema and data to full support for the full UTF-8 range (Emoji, Chinese, etc).

On all record fields that don't currently support 4-byte Emoji characters (i.e utf8mb4), such characters will now be automatically filtered from input (browser, bots, API) rather than generating an error or refusing to save.

* The ticket "Subject" field now properly supports Emoji characters. [[#855](https://github.com/jstanden/cerb/issues/855)] [[#59](https://github.com/jstanden/cerb/issues/59)]

* The worker "Location" and "Title" fields now properly support Emoji characters.

* Comments and sticky notes on records now properly support Emoji characters. [[#796](https://github.com/jstanden/cerb/issues/796)] [[#59](https://github.com/jstanden/cerb/issues/59)]

## Image Editor

### Arbitrary sizes in the image editor

The image editor on records can now specify arbitrary dimensions. Previously this was fixed to 100x100 pixels.

### Default white background in the image editor

The image editor on records now defaults to a white background. When using the monogram option it switches to a dark background. When uploading or fetching an image it switches to a white background.

## Usability

### Spinners on record popup editors

When editing records from card popups, the 'Save Changes' button now shows a spinner icon while in progress. The save button is also disabled to prevent accidental double-clicks.

### Add empty fieldsets to records in automation

In the records API, every record type that supports custom fieldsets may include a 'fieldsets' key with a JSON array or comma-separated list of fieldset IDs. This allows custom fieldsets to be linked to a record before any values are set.

# Data Queries

### Sample geo points

Added a `sample.geo.points` data query type for generating `format:geojson` output. This is necessary for demonstrating map widgets because there aren't any core record types with a coordinates field. The input is a set of `series.<alias>:()` that contain a list of keys like `new_york:(name:"New York" coordinates:"POINT(-73.935242 40.73061)")`. The `coordinates:` key is required (long/lat order), but the other keys are arbitrary and passed through to hover/click events.

<pre>
<code class="language-text">
type:sample.geo.points
series.cities:(
  lihue:(name:"Lihue" coordinates:"POINT(-159.342222 21.978611)")
  new_york:(name:"New York" coordinates:"POINT(-73.935242 40.73061)")
  seattle:(name:"Seattle" coordinates:"POINT(-122.350876 47.620499)")
  berlin:(name:"Berlin" coordinates:"POINT(13.393236 52.504043)")
  sydney:(name: "Sydney" coordinates:"POINT(151.21 -33.868)")
)
format:geojson
</code>
</pre>

### Metadata for worklist subtotal queries

Data queries of type`worklist.subtotals` now return series metadata in the response for all `format:` options. This generates a `query` field for each data point which can be used to quickly run searches from dashboards, bots, or the API.
