**Cerb (9.3.1)** is a **{{ page.release.type }}** released on {{page.date|date:'%B %d, %Y'}}. It includes **{{ page.release.count}}** minor features and fixes from community feedback covering the [9.3](/releases/9.3/) update.  You can [follow these instructions](/docs/upgrading/) to upgrade.

* **[Sheets/UX]** When defining a sheet schema, added autocomplete suggestions to `layout:paging:`.

* **[Sheets/UX]** When defining a sheet schema, added a help link to the docs.

* **[Bots/Tasks]** Fixed an issue with 'New task created' events. If a task was created from a package (e.g. library) then the event only represented the old state of the record (no owner, status, etc).

* **[Code Editors/UX]** Fixed an issue with code editors on search and data queries. When typing `*` the current autocompletion suggestion would stop matching.

* **[Search/Links]** When opening a links popup (e.g. from a profile or card) the search query editor is now properly focused by default.

* **[Bots/Behaviors]** In bot behaviors, fixed an issue with the `Set variable` action when using number-based variables. Placeholders and bot scripts weren't being evaluated.

* **[Bots/Behaviors/Interactions]** In bot behavior editors, fixed an issue with the 'Schedule proactive interaction' action.

* **[API/OAuth2]** In the API, fixed an issue with PUT requests when using OAuth2 tokens.

* **[API/OAuth2]** Fixed an issue with OAuth2 API authentication in PHP versions older than 7.3.

* **[Support Center/Knowledgebase]** In the Support Center, fixed an issue where knowledgebase content wasn't displaying properly.

* **[Records/Messages]** Added the ability to subtotal message records by ticket bucket. This is supported in worklists and data queries.
