# Intelligent Autocomplete Suggestions for Queries

<div class="cerb-screenshot">
<img src="/assets/images/releases/9.3/code_editor_autocomplete.gif" class="screenshot">
</div>

### Autocomplete suggestions in code editors

Code editors now provide syntax highlighting and intelligent autocompletion for search queries, data queries, and YAML when:

* Using search menu popups and worklists

* Configuring worklist or data query based widgets on profile and workspace dashboards

* Configuring privileges and record owner queries in roles

* Customizing the 'Required query' on a worklist

* Using data queries in bot behaviors

* Creating new saved searches

Autocompletion suggestions are presented as you type, based on the position of the text cursor (e.g. within a field/value, in a deep search of a particular record type, etc). The suggestion menu can also be opened manually with the `<CTRL>` + `<SPACE>` keyboard shortcut.

Suggestions are provided for deep searches to any depth (e.g. `ticket:(messages.last:(sender:(org:(`).

Suggestions can be generated from existing record data (e.g. country names, first/last names, worker titles, email addresses). 

Suggestions are scored so that the most frequently used combinations are recommended first (e.g. `status:` on tickets, `email:` on addresses).

Suggestions may include multiple lines of sample content along with fill-in placeholders that can be quickly replaced in sequence with `<TAB>`.

### Quickly access saved searches

Saved searches may be quickly inserted into a query by typing `#` and using the suggestion menu.

Saved searches are also accessible from within the `query:` field in data queries, and in deep searches at any depth.

</div>

### Dynamic suggestions for data queries by type

In data queries, suggestions automatically adapt in real-time to changes the `type:` and `of:`, including multiple series queries.

# Sheets

<div class="cerb-screenshot">
<img src="/assets/images/releases/9.3/sheets.png" class="screenshot">
</div>

[**Worklists**](/docs/worklists/) are great, but they're heavily tied to the database schema (i.e. one field per column) and force default cell formatting on you. They're not responsive, they're too elaborate and unwieldy for bots, and they can't be used to view non-record data.

**Sheets** are a modern, automation-friendly data visualization that avoids the schematic rigidity of worklists. A sheet is still a collection of rows and columns, but its column are defined in a fully customizable YAML-based text schema. This text-based schema can live within a bot behavior or widget without having to be previously defined or saved.

Each column in a sheet has a type (e.g. card, date, link, slider, search, search_button, text, time_elapsed) with configurable options.

For instance, people have regularly asked for a way to change how dates are displayed in a specific worklist (absolute vs relative, 12h vs 24h, localized times, etc). We've also commonly been asked to allow things like colorizing the priority levels from a custom field. Sheets make these customizations really easy.

A _cell_ (the intersection of a specific row and column) doesn't have to relate to a schema field at all -- it can be a synthetic or computed value, translation, interactive element, deep-linked field, arbitrary output, etc.

Sheets use placeholder dictionaries to to render cells, and they receive their input from any data query that can generate dictionaries -- including `worklist.subtotals` and a new `worklist.records` data query type that significantly simplifies fetching record data. This means that sheets can also easily format and display data from third-party APIs. The data query itself, being text, supports placeholders and bot scripting logic -- so you can determine which columns are available, or what a cell displays, based not only on aspects of the record, but also based on on who is looking at it, their permissions, etc.

State on sheets is maintained client-side, and paging/sorting/filtering is customized for the use case (e.g. bot interaction vs portal vs dashboard widget) -- essentially just passing simple information to the input data query.

For example, this **data query**:

<pre>
<code class="language-text">
type:worklist.records
of:ticket
query:(status:open limit:5)
expand:[initial_message_sender_org_,owner_]
format:dictionaries
</code>
</pre>

And this **sheet schema**:

<pre>
<code class="language-yaml">
{% raw %}
layout:
  style: table
  headings: true
  paging: true
  title_column: _label
columns:
- key: _label
  label: Ticket
  type: card
  params:
    bold: true
- key: initial_message_sender__label
  label: Requester
  type: card
  params:
    underline: false
- key: initial_message_sender_org_country
  label: Country
  type: text
- key: group__label
  label: Group / Bucket
  type: custom
  params:
    template: >-
      {{group__label}} / {{bucket__label}}
- key: owner__label
  label: Owner
  type: card
  params:
    image: true
    underline: false
- key: importance
  type: slider
- key: updated
  label: Updated
  type: date
  params:
    format: Y-m-d
{% endraw %}
</code>
</pre>

Will display this **sheet**:

<div class="cerb-screenshot">
<img src="/assets/images/releases/9.3/sheet-example.png" class="screenshot">
</div>

Unlike a worklist that is limited to records, the results of the data query above could have come from anywhere (third-party API call, subtotals, computation). As text, sheets can be quickly modified and shared, retrieved from the API, or constructed dynamically by bots.

You'll also notice that we're displaying the country of the initial sender's organization as a column. The group and bucket are displayed as a single column. We're electing which columns to show cards and profile images for. We're changing the date format. All of this wasn't possible with worklists.

## Columns

### Card

The `card`  column type displays a link that opens the card popup for a particular record.

The record to display is specified with the `context:` and `id:` params for a static record (e.g. `task:123`), or `context_key:` and `id_key:` for displaying a dynamic record based on dictionary keys. If omitted, this defaults to the current record using `context_key: _context` and `id_key: id`. If `key:` ends with `_id` or `_label` (e.g. `group__label`) then Cerb will attempt to automatically figure out the context, id, and label by using the dictionary.

This is also capable of displaying cards for deeply-nested related records (e.g. ticket >> latest message >> sender >> org >> email).

Similarly, the label for the link can be specified using `label:` (static) or `label_key:` (dynamic).

If an `image: true` param is provided, a profile image will be displayed to the left of the link.

The `bold:` and `underline:` params control how the link is displayed.

<pre>
<code class="language-yaml">
columns:
- key: name
  type: card
  label: Name
  params:
    context_key: _context
    id_key: id
    label_key: _label
    image: true
    bold: true
    underline: true
</code>
</pre>

### Date

The `date` column type displays a datetime in various formats. The default is a relative timestamp (e.g. "2 hours ago"). An arbitrary `format:` may be specified using options from <http://php.net/date>.

The timestamp can be provided as `value:` (a Unix timestamp in seconds) or `value_key:` (a dictionary key containing a Unix timestamp). When both of these are omitted, the `key:` is used.

<pre>
<code class="language-yaml">
columns:
- key: updated
  label: Updated
  type: date
  params:
    format: d-M-Y H:i:s T # See: https://php.net/date
    #value: 1577836800
    #value_key: updated
</code>
</pre>

### Link

The `link` column type displays a relative or external link with some text.

The link is provided in the `href:` (or `href_key:`, `href_template:`) param. For instance: `/path/to/page`, `https://cerb.ai`.

The `text:` (or `text_key:`, `text_template:`) param provides the label of the link.

<pre>
<code class="language-yaml">
{% raw %}
columns:
- key: link
  type: link
  label: Link
  params:
    #href: https://example.com/
    href_key: record_url
    #href_template: /profiles/task/{{id}}-{{title|permalink}}
    #text: Link title
    text_key: _label
    #text_template: "{{title}}"
{% endraw %}
</code>
</pre>

### Search

The `search` column type displays arbitrary text as a link with `label:` or (`label_key:`, `label_template:`).

Clicking the links runs search `query:` (or `query_key:`, `query_template:`) against `context:` (or `context_key:`, `context_template:`) records.

For instance, a table of calculated results could open a search popup to the source data.

<pre>
<code class="language-yaml">
{% raw %}
columns:
- key: count
  type: search
  label: Count
  params:
    context: ticket
    #query_key: query
    query_template: owner.id:{{id}}
{% endraw %}
</code>
</pre>

### Search Button

The `search_button` column type displays a search button that opens a worklist popup with the results of a query for a given record type.

The record type to search is specified in the `context:` param (or `context_key:`, `context_template:`).

The `query:` (or `query_key:`, `query_template:`) param contains the search query.

The `label:` (or `label_key:`, `label_template:`) param provides the text of the search link.

<pre>
<code class="language-yaml">
{% raw %}
columns:
- key: assignments_search
  type: search_button
  label: Assignments
  params:
    context: ticket
    #query_key: query
    query_template: owner.id:{{id}}
{% endraw %}
</code>
</pre>

### Slider

The `slider` column type visually displays a `value:` (or `value_key:`, `value_template:`) on a continuum with configurable `min:` and `max:` bounds. The output is similar to the "Importance" column on ticket/task worklists.

<pre>
<code class="language-yaml">
{% raw %}
columns:
- key: importance
  label: Importance
  type: slider
  params:
    min: 0
    max: 100
    #value: 50
    #value_key: importance
    #value_template: "{{importance}}+10}}"
{% endraw %}
</code>
</pre>

### Text

The `text` column type displays arbitrary text as `value:` (or `value_key:`, `value_template:`) using bot scripting and placeholders. The default value is the column's `key:` in the placeholder dictionary.

Text columns may include a `value_map:` parameter for associating new labels to values. For instance, "F => Female" or "1 => Yes". This reduces the need for custom columns.

This type is usually the default when no column `type:` is specified.

<pre>
<code class="language-yaml">
{% raw %}
columns:
- key: gender
  label: Gender
  type: text
  params:
    #value: Female
    #value_key: gender
    #value_template: "{{gender}}"
    value_map:
      F: Female
      M: Male
{% endraw %}
</code>
</pre>

### Time Elapsed

The `time_elapsed` column type convert units of time (like seconds) into human-friendly dates (e.g. "2 hours, 5 mins").

The `value:` (or `value_key:`, `value_template:`) parameter specifies the value. If omitted, the value of the column key is used.

The `precision` parameter controls how granular the date is. For instance, `precision: 3` is _"2 hours, 5 minutes, 29 seconds"_. The default is `2`.

<pre>
<code class="language-yaml">
columns:
- key: elapsed_response_first
  label: First Response
  type: time_elapsed
  params:
    precision: 2
</code>
</pre>

## Layout

### Tables

By default, sheets display as a **table** of rows and columns.

<pre>
<code class="language-yaml">
layout:
  style: table
</code>
</pre>

### Fieldsets

<div class="cerb-screenshot">
<img src="/assets/images/releases/9.3/sheet-fieldsets.png" class="screenshot">
</div>

The `fieldsets` layout style displays rows as **fieldsets** (vertically) rather than a table (horizontal). This is useful on profiles to summarize a single record, and in mobile environments.

<pre>
<code class="language-yaml">
layout:
  style: fieldsets
</code>
</pre>

# Form Interactions

[**Conversational bot interactions**](/docs/bots/interactions/) (e.g. chat bots) addressed a major need in having dynamic conversations with bots as automated workflow helpers, but chat has several big limitations.

One of the major things people have complained about with the chat approach is that you have to go back-and-forth so many times with a single question and response to do something common like creating a new record. Chat was meant to replace boring and rigid forms, but in several cases forms felt more efficient.

We drew inspiration from the best parts of chat bots in Cerb, while addressing the artificial constraints imposed by chat vs forms, and created **form interactions**. [[#941](https://github.com/jstanden/cerb/issues/941)]

<div class="cerb-screenshot">
<img src="/assets/images/releases/9.3/form-interactions.gif" class="screenshot">
</div>

Form interactions build dynamic multi-step web forms that adapt in real-time based on user input. They are similar to conversational interactions (they can do everything a chat bot does), but they display a collection of prompts (e.g. given name, family name, email address, phone number) and responses as a single step.

Form interactions enhance forms by allowing elements to be added conditionally (within the behavior as actions). They also make validation and multi-step form behaviors trivial to implement. Form interactions automatically save and resume a user's progress between refreshes and page loads.

For instance, you could create a survey or troubleshooter where each page adapts based on the previous inputs. The pages could incorporate info from external APIs. The results can turn into email, custom records, POST to a webhook, etc.

Even more interestingly, multiple form interactions can be attached to a single dashboard/profile widget like shortcuts (like the actions on a ticket profile). Selecting an interaction starts a bot session with the given worker and record in the scope.

On a dashboard, you could have a form interaction for quickly creating records for specific situations, using purpose-specific combinations of custom fields and field defaults. You could have a form interaction widget on ticket profiles for quickly creating tasks linked to the ticket, or for retrieving information (from anywhere) related to it.

Form interactions really make bots feel like the intelligent agents they aspired to be.

### Prompt with CAPTCHA challenge

The "Prompt with CAPTCHA challenge" action generates a random image with a series of semi-obscured characters for the user to type, with the intention of making automated submission of the form difficult for robots and easy for humans. This is particularly useful on public-facing forms.

<div class="cerb-screenshot">
<img src="/assets/images/releases/9.3/form-interaction-prompt-captcha.png" class="screenshot">
</div>

### Prompt with multiple choices

The "Prompt with multiple choices" action displays a series of pre-defined options as checkboxes where a user may make multiple selections. The min/max number of selections can be configured with the validation template by checking the length of the array in the resulting placeholder.

<div class="cerb-screenshot">
<img src="/assets/images/releases/9.3/form-interaction-prompt-choices.png" class="screenshot">
</div>

### Prompt with single choice

The "Prompt with single choice" action displays a series of radio buttons where the user may only select one. The options can be configured to display vertically or horizontally. When this prompt is the only element on a form, making a selection will automatically continue to the next step.

<div class="cerb-screenshot">
<img src="/assets/images/releases/9.3/form-interaction-prompt-choice.png" class="screenshot">
</div>

### Prompt with text

The "Prompt with text" action may be configured to prompt for a single line or multiple lines of text. The validation template enforces the desired input (number, email address, min/max length, etc). A label, default value, and input hint may be provided to assist with data entry.

<div class="cerb-screenshot">
<img src="/assets/images/releases/9.3/form-interaction-prompt-text.png" class="screenshot">
</div>

### Prompt with submit

The "Prompt with submit" action displays a new page of the form with any elements that have been added up to the current point. During the submit action, all prompts must pass validation before the user may continue to the next step.

<div class="cerb-screenshot">
<img src="/assets/images/releases/9.3/form-interaction-prompt-submit.png" class="screenshot">
</div>

### Respond with sheet

The "Respond with sheet" action takes a data query and sheet schema as input, and displays highly customizable sheet of rows and columns within the form. This makes it very easy to display search results (from records or an API) in the form.

<div class="cerb-screenshot">
<img src="/assets/images/releases/9.3/form-interaction-respond-sheet.png" class="screenshot">
</div>

### Respond with text

The "Respond with text" action displays a block of arbitrary text in HTML, Markdown, or plaintext format. It can be used for section titles, instructions, etc.

<div class="cerb-screenshot">
<img src="/assets/images/releases/9.3/form-interaction-respond-text.png" class="screenshot">
</div>

# Data Queries

### Load record data

Added `type:worklist.records` data queries for retrieving record dictionaries. This is how sheets load record data.

<pre>
<code class="language-text">
type:worklist.records
of:tickets
expand:[
  group_,
  bucket_,
  latest_message_sender_
]
query:(
  status:!d
  limit:10
  sort:id
)
page:0
format:dictionaries
</code>
</pre>

### Improved data query tester

The **Setup >> Developers >> Data Query Tester** tool now supports autocompletion and the JSON results support syntax highlighting and code formatting.

<div class="cerb-screenshot">
<img src="/assets/images/releases/9.3/data-query-tester.png" class="screenshot">
</div>

### Dictionary output in subtotal queries

In `worklist.subtotals` dictionaries, `format:dictionaries` is now supported. This returns subtotal stats as dictionaries which can be displayed in sheets or through the API.

A new `expand:[]` option for key expansion in the dictionaries. This allows visualizations (like sheets) to expand record details, which wasn't possible with 'table' widgets previously.

### Improved validation

Data queries now return an error when an unknown parameter is given. This protects against issues like using `qury:` instead of `query:` and showing an unfiltered list.

<div class="cerb-screenshot">
<img src="/assets/images/releases/9.3/data-query-unknown-param.png" class="screenshot">
</div>

### Required queries

Data queries that accept a `query:` parameter now also accept a `query.required:` parameter, which establishes the subset of records that are visible regardless of user-level filtering.

The `query.required:` input should be protected against user-provided placeholders. This is important as data queries power more user-facing functionality (e.g. portals), and paging/sorting/filtering are provided as `query:` parameters.

<div class="cerb-screenshot">
<img src="/assets/images/releases/9.3/data-query-required-query.png" class="screenshot">
</div>

### Subtotal by date-based custom fields

In `type:worklist.subtotals` data queries, implemented the ability to subtotal `by:` on date-based custom fields.

# Dashboards

### Form interaction widgets

Implemented form interaction widgets for workspace dashboards. Multiple form interactions can be configured and the widget will display a button menu to select one. This improves maintainability since each interaction doesn't require its own widget, and each interaction doesn't need to perform multiple duties.

### Sheet widgets

Implemented sheet widgets for workspace dashboards. The following column types are currently supported: `card`, `date`, `link`, `search`, `search_button`, `slider`, `text`, and `time_elapsed`.

# Profiles

### Form interaction widgets

Implemented form interaction widgets for profiles. Multiple form interactions can be configured and the widget will display a button menu to select one. This improves maintainability since each interaction doesn't require its own widget, and each interaction doesn't need to perform multiple duties. The widget can pass input variables to form interaction behaviors using placeholders from the current record.

### Sheet widgets

Implemented sheet widgets for profiles. This uses placeholders from the current record to run a data query to populate the sheet. The following column types are currently supported: `card`, `date`, `link`, `search`, `search_button`, `slider`, `text`, and `time_elapsed`.

# Bots

### Record ID behavior variables

Bot behaviors may define 'Record ID' variables. These variables are configured as a specific record type (e.g. task) and store a single record ID.

When the variable name ends with an `_id` suffix, the records dictionary will be available for key expansion at that path.

For instance, a variable named `var_ticket_id` will provide placeholders like `var_ticket_subject` and `var_ticket_group__label`.

This drastically simplifies behaviors that receive a record ID; particularly bot interactions.

### Variables in behavior dictionaries

Bot behavior dictionaries now include a `variables` key with information about its public/private variables (e.g. name, key, type). 

This can be used by any functionality to discover a behavior's inputs and build prompts for them.

# Packages

### Participants sheet on ticket profiles

On ticket profiles, the 'Participants' package now uses a sheet widget to display a list of participants. Previously this was a custom HTML widget which lacked paging, formatting, etc.

<div class="cerb-screenshot">
<img src="/assets/images/releases/9.3/profiles-ticket-participants.png" class="screenshot">
</div>

### Sheet packages

Added sheet examples to the package library for workspace widgets.

### Form interactions

Added a form interaction example to the package library for bot behaviors.
