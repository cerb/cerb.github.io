**Cerb (9.3.9)** is a **{{ page.release.type }}** released on {{page.date|date:'%B %d, %Y'}}. It includes **{{ page.release.count}}** minor features and fixes from community feedback covering the [9.3](/releases/9.3/) update.  You can [follow these instructions](/docs/upgrading/) to upgrade.

* **[Records/Custom Records]** On custom record profile widgets, the `name_plural` and `uri` fields are now available.

* **[Profiles/Widgets]** Fixed an issue with 'Custom' profile widgets where the current widget placeholders weren't available in the bot behavior. Thanks to [@beatbesmer](https://github.com/beatbesmer) for the report.

* **[Records/Log]** On activity log worklists, when the required query filters to a specific record, the target label is now hidden in the event description. For example, without a target, the log entry may read "Kina Halpue changed ticket [ABC-12345-678] Ticket Subject to status deleted". When viewed from the profile of the ticket, it would now instead read "Kina Halpue changed ticket to status deleted". The viewer knows they are looking at that specific ticket and repeating its name on every line is unnecessary.

* **[Records/Activity Log]** In activity log dictionaries, the new `params` key is an array of key/value metadata associated with the log entry. This enables custom rendering and processing of log entries beyond what is displayed by default.
