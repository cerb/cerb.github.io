**Cerb (9.4.1)** is a **{{ page.release.type }}** released on {{page.date|date:'%B %d, %Y'}}. It includes **{{ page.release.count}}** minor features and fixes from community feedback covering the [9.4](/releases/9.4/) update.  You can [follow these instructions](/docs/upgrading/) to upgrade.

* **[Localization/Translations]** Added a Polish translation.

* **[Docs/Record Types]** Updated record type metadata for documentation generation.

* **[Records/Drafts]** Removed the need to specify a `ticket_id` in the draft params for `ticket.reply` and `ticket.forward` when using the records API. This is already included as a draft field.

* **[Dashboards/Widgets]** Fixed an issue on dashboards when displaying project board widgets. Hovering over the widget also toggled the board column drag handles.

* **[Cards/Widgets/Sheets]** Fixed an issue with paging on sheet card widgets. [[#1069](https://github.com/jstanden/cerb/issues/1069)]

* **[Bots/Scripting/Performance]** In bot scripting, optimized the performance of the `|context_alias` filter.

* **[Records/Performance]** In record search and data queries, optimized the performance of the `links:`, `on:`, and `owner:` filters. These were loading the available record types inefficiently.

* **[Mail/Compose]** Fixed an issue on a new compose popup where the `#signature` command wasn't included by default.

* **[KB/Editor]** Converted the knowledgebase article popup to a text editor (from a code editor) so native browser spellchecking works. [[#1093](https://github.com/jstanden/cerb/issues/1093)]

* **[KB/Editor]** On the knowledgebase editor, files can be dragged and dropped into the 'Attachments' section.

* **[KB/Editor]** On the knowledgebase editor, files and images can be pasted directly into the text editor. If pasting an image, the Markdown syntax for inline images will be automatically inserted at the cursor.

* **[Dashboards/Widgets/UX]** Improved usability when dragging widgets around on a dashboard.

* **[Workspaces/Form Interactions]** Fixed an issue on workspace dashboards where multiple form interaction widgets could share state with each other. [[#1095](https://github.com/jstanden/cerb/issues/1095)]
