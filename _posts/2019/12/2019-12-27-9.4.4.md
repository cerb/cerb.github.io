**Cerb (9.4.4)** is a **{{ page.release.type }}** released on {{page.date|date:'%B %d, %Y'}}. It includes **{{ page.release.count}}** minor features and fixes from community feedback covering the [9.4](/releases/9.4/) update.  You can [follow these instructions](/docs/upgrading/) to upgrade.

* **[Mail/Compose/Reply/UX]** When composing and replying to mail, the `#command` and `@mention` autocomplete menus are now automatically focused. Previously this was requiring users to navigate with the arrow keys first.

* **[Comments/UX]** When commenting on a record, the `@mention` autocomplete menu is now automatically focused. Previously this was requiring users to navigate with the arrow keys first.

* **[Mail/Compose/Reply/UX]** When composing and replying to mail, the `Ctrl/Alt + Return` keyboard shortcut continues to focus the 'Send' button, requiring an extra `Return` to confirm. The `Ctrl/Alt + Shift + Return` keyboard shortcut now immediately sends the message.

* **[Comments/UX]** When commenting on a record, the `Ctrl/Alt + Return` keyboard shortcut continues to focus the 'Save Changes' button, requiring an extra `Return` to confirm. The `Shift + Ctrl/Alt + Return` keyboard shortcut now immediately saves the comment.

* **[Records/Editors/Comments]** On record editor popups that offer the 'Comment' option, the `Ctrl/Alt + Return` keyboard shortcut now focuses the 'Save Changes' button. The `Shift + Ctrl/Alt + Return` keyboard shortcut immediately saves the record.

* **[Debug]** Fixed an issue on the `/debug/status` endpoint where counts were being returned for `project_boards` and `webhooks` even when those plugins were disabled. This caused extraneous entries in the PHP error log.

* **[Mail/Comments/UX]** When composing and replying to mail, or commenting, the autocomplete suggestions for `#commands` and `@mentions` are now triggered after a 150ms delay in typing rather than 300ms.

* **[Mail/Comments/UX]** When composing and replying to mail, or commenting, the autocomplete suggestions for `@mentions` now include a trailing space in the inserted text. This reduces the extra keystroke.
