# Changelog

## Added

* **[API/Automations]** In the REST API, a new endpoint ([automations/logs/search.json](/docs/api/endpoints/automations/)) searches automation log entries using queries. This makes it much easier to keep an eye on automation errors with external monitoring tools. Thanks to [ChargeOver](https://chargeover.com/) for the feature request.
