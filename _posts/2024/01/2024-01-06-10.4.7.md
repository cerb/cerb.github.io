# Changelog

## Added

* **[Search/Keyboard/UX]** Added `/` as a global keyboard shortcut for the search menu. Thanks to [Flexibits](https://flexibits.com/) for the feature request!

* **[Interactions/Worker]** In `interaction.worker` automations, a `client_url` input now provides a worker's current URL. For instance, this can be used by a custom explore mode to return the worker to their original location once finished. Thanks to [@mryanb](https://github.com/mryanb/) for the feature request!

## Fixed

* **[API]** Fixed an issue in the API where JSON responses were empty if they contained invalid UTF-8 bytes. For instance, the `content_html` expansion key on `/records/search/message.json`. Thanks to [1Password](https://1password.com/) for the bug report.

* **[Search/UX]** Fixed keyboard navigation in the global search menu. It's now possible to select a record type with the `Enter` key.

* **[Records/Maint]** When records are deleted, the associated merge history entries are now properly removed as well.

* **[Metrics/Maint]** When custom metrics are deleted, their historical metric values are now properly deleted as well.
