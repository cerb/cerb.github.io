## Changed

* **[Platform/Database]** In the database service, queries will no longer be retried if they aborted due to a read timeout. This could lead to unexpected duplicate queries (e.g. during nightly maintenance). Queries are only retried if the database server was offline and became available again during the retry window (2 second intervals for 10 seconds).

## Fixed

* **[Platform/Database/Performance]** Fixed an issue in the database service where the read timeout was too short (5 seconds). This was originally lowered to counter a rare connection exhaustion issue when a database server opens new connections but doesn't respond in a reasonable amount of time. In PHP, the connection timeout only includes the socket, and "time to first byte" is instead covered by the read timeout. When the read timeout is too short, it can abort legitimate queries with a "MySQL server went away" error. This was particularly apparent during nightly maintenance or version upgrades. These queries would eventually complete on the server, but Cerb could unexpectedly run expensive queries in parallel, or retry the same query as if it had failed.

* **[Mail/Reply/UX]** Fixed an issue in mail where it was possible to click the 'Reply' or 'Send' buttons multiple times during network latency, particularly when using keyboard shortcuts. This could lead to duplicate drafts or sent messages. These buttons are now properly rate-limited to 500ms per click. Thanks to [1Password](https://1password.com/) for reporting the bug!
