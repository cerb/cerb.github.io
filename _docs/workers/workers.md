The people who officially represent your team to the outside world are called **workers**.

These are your full-time and part-time staff, interns, volunteers, managers, executives, investors, and partners.

Workers log in to Cerb using their standard web browser (e.g. Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Opera, Edge) on desktop computers, laptops, tablets, or smartphones. A single worker can be logged in from multiple devices at the same time.

This flexibility allows your team to get work done from almost anywhere.
