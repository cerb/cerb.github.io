[Workers](/docs/workers) with similar skills and responsibilities are organized into **groups**. How members are assigned to a group is completely up to you, but groups generally map to existing departments or teams: Sales, Support, Development, Billing, Corporate.

Each worker in a group is a **member**. A member with the authority to administer the group is a **manager**. Groups can have any number of managers.

The units of work assigned to a group are organized into any number of **buckets**, which can be thought of like folders: Leads, Receipts, Newsletters, Refunds, Spam.

Every group has an **inbox** bucket where new work is delivered by default. This work is then sorted into the appropriate buckets by workers or [bots](/docs/bots).
