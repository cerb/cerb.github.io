Licenses are based on the maximum number of workers able to log in at the same time (i.e. _seats_). The software can be deployed on independent servers, or as a fully-managed, cloud-based service.

If you [purchased a Cerb license](/pricing/license) you can enter it here to increase your seats.  Without a license, Cerb operates in **evaluation mode** with a single seat but no other restrictions.

If you have a [Cerb Cloud](/cloud/) subscription then you won't see this section.
