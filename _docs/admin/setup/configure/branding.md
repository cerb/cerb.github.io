Navigate to **Setup** >> **Configure** >> **Branding**

<div class="cerb-screenshot">
<img src="/assets/images/docs/setup/branding.png" class="screenshot">
</div>

You can add your own logo to the top left using three different ways.

In the bottom left of the default logo there is an edit button below the image in the **Logo** section. Clicking
that button will allow you to upload an image directly from your machine into Cerb.

The **Custom Stylesheet** allows you to modify your entire instance of Cerb, but you can target your logo to
manually force its height and width or change its dimensions at certain resolutions. 

You can also use the **Favicon URL** from your organization's website. 
This is the icon that people see when they add links to their bookmarks.  For example: `http://example.com/favicon.ico`

The **Browser Title** is the label you see on browser tabs and saved bookmarks by default.

When finished, click the **Save Changes** button.
