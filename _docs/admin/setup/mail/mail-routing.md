Navigate to **Setup** >> **Mail** >> **Routing**

You can configure rules to automatically route new mail to groups based on message properties.

For example, you may want to route messages addressed to `support@*` to the **Support** group, `orders@*` to **Sales**, and `receipts@*` to **Billing**.

These messages will be delivered to the **Inbox** bucket in those groups, and group managers can configure additional sorting from there.
