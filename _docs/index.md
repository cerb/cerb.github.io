* A library of __browser-installable plugins__ for extending functionality and integrating with other applications and services (Facebook, Twitter, Twilio, Slack, Freshbooks, Amazon S3, JIRA, HipChat, etc).

* A __REST-based API__ for automation and integration with third-party applications and services.

Cerb has continuously evolved for more than 15 years based on community feedback from thousands of teams.

The software is distributed under the [Devblocks Public License](/license) as a commercial open source project. The full source code is publicly available on GitHub[^github].

Licenses are based on the maximum number of workers able to log in at the same time (i.e. seats). The software can be deployed on independent servers, or as a fully-managed, cloud-based service.

Cerb is developed in the PHP[^php] programming language. Relational data is stored in MySQL[^mysql]. See the [credits](/docs/credits) for a full list of third-party libraries, resources, and contributors.
