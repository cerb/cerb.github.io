[Ticket](/docs/tickets/) priority is determined by the **importance** field. You'll encounter importance as a simple slider where you can nudge it up or down as needed.

The importance field can also be automatically adjusted by [bots](/docs/bots) in response to service level committments, escalations, etc.
