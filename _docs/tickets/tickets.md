You can think of a **ticket** as a brief project based on a specific question or issue.

The ticket's [profile](/docs/records/profiles/) page is a workspace that groups together email correspondence, comments, attachments, etc.

Each ticket functions like a private mailing list. Any number of [contacts](/docs/contacts/) can join a ticket conversation as **participants**, and they will receive a copy of all outgoing email messages from your team.

Tickets are sorted into [buckets](/docs/buckets/) within [groups](/docs/groups/).

The worker who is currently responsible for a ticket's completion is its **owner**.
