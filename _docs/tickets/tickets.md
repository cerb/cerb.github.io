You can think of a **ticket** as a brief project based on a specific question or issue.

The ticket's [profile](/docs/records/profiles/) page is a workspace that groups together email correspondence, comments, attachments, etc.

Each ticket functions like a private mailing list. Any number of [contacts](/docs/contacts/) may be subscribed to a ticket conversation as **participants**, and they will receive a copy of all outgoing email messages from your team.

Tickets are sorted into [buckets](/docs/buckets/) within [groups](/docs/groups/).

The [worker](/docs/workers/) who is currently responsible for a ticket's completion is its **owner**.

# Masks

Every ticket is automatically assigned a unique, non-sequential reference **mask**, like `RYS-07092-012`.

The term _"mask"_ refers to the fact that the randomized reference number (opposed to a numeric ID) doesn't disclose information about your total number of tickets or your daily email volume.

A contact can provide the first three letters of the mask for quick lookups.

# Status

The **status** of a [ticket](/docs/tickets/) is always one of the following:

- **open**: the conversation needs worker attention.
- **waiting for reply**: the conversation is on hold pending client action.
- **closed**: the conversation has concluded.
- **deleted**: the conversation is flagged for deletion during the next maintenance window.

You'll most likely have at least one worklist dedicated to _open_ tickets if you're responsible for responding to inquiries from contacts.

When a ticket is changed to the _waiting_ status you can also schedule a **wait until** date and time, at which point the conversation will automatically return to the _open_ status.  This keeps your inbox free of tickets that you can't work on until a later date.  It's also a great way to schedule followups on sales or marketing messages.

If a contact adds a new message to a ticket that is _waiting_ or _closed_ it will automatically change back to the _open_ status.

By default, when a ticket is deleted you will have 7 days from its last activity to change it to a different status before it's removed permanently.  This is called the _"undo window"_.

# Importance

Ticket priority is determined by the **importance** field. You'll encounter importance as a simple slider where you can nudge it up or down as needed.

The importance field can also be automatically adjusted by [bots](/docs/bots) in response to service level committments, escalations, etc.

# Response Times

Cerb records ticket-level **response time** information in two fields:

- **First response**: the total time elapsed before the first response from a worker. This focuses on the first response so that it isn't skewed by later delays that may be attributed to the client.

- **First resolution**: the total time elapsed before the ticket was first changed to the _closed_ status. This isn't affected by subsequent changes between the _open_ and _closed_ statuses that may occur when you get stuck in a loop of _"Thanks!"_ and _"You're welcome!"_ -- especially because that may occur days after the ticket was actually resolved.

When a worker responds to a specific client message, Cerb also records the response time on the worker's message. This encourages workers to respond quickly, even if it's only to say, _"Let me check on that and get right back to you"._

# Anti-spam

Cerb performs a simple statistical analysis of the contents of the first message on new [tickets](/docs/tickets/) to predict whether a message is spam or not.

The predicted probability of being spam is stored as a **spam score** on the ticket.

By itself, this prediction has no effect on tickets. However, the computed score can be used by [bots](/docs/bots/) and [workers](/docs/workers/) to filter mail when desirable.

The spam predictions improve and adapt over time through training.  When a worker replies to a client message, Cerb learns to be more approving of similar messages in the future.

When workers click the **Report spam** button on a ticket, Cerb becomes more critical of similar messages in the future.

# Drafts

**Drafts** automatically save the current progress of a worker's message before they send it. This allows a composed message to be resumed at a later date, and it provides a _backup_ (e.g. the browser crashes or otherwise unintentionally closes).

Drafts are displayed in a ticket's conversation timeline, which instantly lets _other_ workers know that a response is being sent so they can move on to a different ticket.  This prevents _duplication of effort_.

Similarly, a trainee can ask a supervisor to review their draft before they send a message to a client.

# Merge

Related tickets from the same participants can be **merged** together into a single ticket, which combines all of the messages and comments.

# Split

Conversely, if a ticket conversation diverges into multiple topics that would be better handled by other groups or workers, one or more messages can be **split** off into new tickets.
