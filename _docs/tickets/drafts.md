**Drafts** automatically save the current progress of a worker's message before they send it. This allows a composed message to be resumed at a later date, and it provides a _backup_ (e.g. the browser crashes or otherwise unintentionally closes).

Drafts are displayed in a ticket's conversation timeline, which instantly lets _other_ workers know that a response is being sent so they can move on to a different ticket.  This prevents _duplication of effort_.

Similarly, a trainee can ask a supervisor to review their draft before they send a message to a client.
