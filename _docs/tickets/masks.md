Every [ticket](/docs/tickets/) is automatically assigned a unique, non-sequential reference **mask**, like `RYS-07092-012`.

The term _"mask"_ refers to the fact that the randomized reference number (opposed to a numeric ID) doesn't disclose information about your total number of tickets or your daily email volume.

A contact can provide the first three letters of the mask for quick lookups.
