## Pages

The _navigation bar_ displays shortcuts to your favorite [workspace pages](/docs/workspaces).

You can use your mouse to drag workspace pages into a different order. The first item in your navbar is your default page.

New pages are added by clicking on the downward-pointing arrow at the end of the list.

## Logo

You can click on the logo in the top left from anywhere in Cerb to quickly return to your default page. This is a shortcut for clicking on the the first page in your [navigation bar](#pages).

## Worker Menu

Clicking on your name in the top right reveals the worker menu with actions specific to your account.

## Search

You can quickly view and filter records of any type from the [search](/docs/search/) menu in the top right. Each search popup is a temporary [workspace](/docs/workspaces).
