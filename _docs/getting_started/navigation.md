## Pages

You can use your mouse to drag workspace pages into a different order. The first item in your navbar is your default page.

New pages are added by clicking on the downward-pointing arrow at the end of the list.

## Logo

You can click on the logo in the top left from anywhere in Cerb to quickly return to your default page. This is a shortcut for clicking on the the first page in your [navigation bar](#pages).
