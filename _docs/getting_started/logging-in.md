**Cerb** is a web-based application. You can access it from anywhere by using a web browser on a device with Internet access -- a desktop computer, laptop, tablet, or smartphone.

Using your web browser, navigate to the URL for your copy of Cerb.

If you don't have a copy of Cerb yet, you can <a href="/signup/">start a free evaluation</a>. We'll set up everything for you and send over the login information.

### Authenticate yourself
