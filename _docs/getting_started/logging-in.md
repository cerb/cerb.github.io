When you first access Cerb in your browser you'll be prompted to authenticate yourself.

It's possible for each worker to have a different authentication method, so the first step is to enter your registered email address.  If you check the **Remember me** box then you won't need to enter your email address again on subsequent visits, even if you log out.

After clicking **Continue** you'll be shown your personalized authentication form.  By default you'll be asked for a password, but you may see something different if two-factor authentication is enabled (requiring a temporary code from your mobile device).

After entering your credentials, click the **Log In** button.

If successful, your new session will begin and you'll be redirected to your profile page.

If you forgot your password, click the **forgot your password?** link to reset your account.  This will require you to verify your email address, and it may ask you a few security questions to verify your identity.  If you need additional help, contact your administrator.
