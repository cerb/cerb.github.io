**Cerb** is a web-based application. You can access it from anywhere by using a web browser on a device with Internet access -- a desktop computer, laptop, tablet, or smartphone.

Using your web browser, navigate to the URL for your copy of Cerb.

If you don't have a copy of Cerb yet, you can <a href="javascript:;" data-cerb-bot-interaction="cloud" data-cerb-bot-param-mode="signup">start a free evaluation</a>. We'll set up everything for you and send over the login information.

### Enter your email address

Each account can be authenticated in a different way. For this reason, signing in to your account is a two-step process.

In the first step, enter the email address linked to your account:

</div>

<div class="cerb-box note">
<p>If you check the <i>"Remember me"</i> box then you won't need to enter your email address again on subsequent visits (even after you log out).</p>
</div>

### Authenticate yourself

After clicking the **Continue** button you'll be shown your personalized authentication form.  By default you'll be asked for a password, but you may see something different if two-factor authentication is enabled (requiring a temporary code from your mobile device).

After entering your credentials, click the **Log In** button.

If successful, your new session will begin and you'll be redirected to your profile page.

### Register

If you've been invited to create an account but haven't done so yet, you'll need to finish the registration process before logging in.

### Forgot your password?

If you forgot your password, click the **forgot your password?** link to reset your account.  This will require you to verify your email address, and it may ask you a few security questions to verify your identity.

If you need additional help, contact your administrator.
