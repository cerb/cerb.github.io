**Comments** can be added to [records](/docs/records/) for documenting changes, coordinating work, and asking questions.

For instance, as progress is made on a task it can be documented with comments.  This allows workers to quickly share information, as well as building a historical record for later review.

Specific workers can also be addressed with an **@mention** to send them a [notification](/docs/notifications/) about the comment. Any number of workers can be notified at the same time by including multiple mentions anywhere in the comment.

A record's [watchers](/docs/watchers/) will automatically receive a notification when new comments are added.
