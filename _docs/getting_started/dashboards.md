# Dashboards

**Dashboards** extend [workspaces](/docs/workspaces/) by providing visual insight with highly customizable **widgets**.



### Charts
 
### Subtotals

Grab the subtotal counts against a field on any worklist and display them as a table or pie chart.

### Gauges

Gauges are similar to a counter, but they allow you to create multiple thresholds within a range.  For instance, the average response time of a group can be displayed as a gauge with thresholds for "excellent", "acceptable", and "unacceptable".

### Clocks

### Countdowns

Plot records on bar and line charts using quantitative fields.  Add multiple series to the same chart for comparisons between record sets or over historical time periods.

### Counters

Display an aggregated count, sum, average, min, or max using any quantitative field from a set of records. Display the result as a number, decimal, percentage, number of seconds, minutes, or bytes.

### Custom HTML

Display arbitrary HTML content and Javascript.  This is most often used to display widgets from other systems.


### Donut and Pie Charts

Segment arbitrary JSON data as a donut or pie chart.
