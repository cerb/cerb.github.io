# Dashboards

**Dashboards** extend [workspaces](/docs/workspaces/) by providing visual insight with highly customizable **widgets**.

 and solution recommendations.
 
### Calendars

Calendars work well for keeping track of important dates, deadlines, and schedules of other workers.

### Chart: Categories
<div class="cerb-screenshot">
<img src="/assets/images/docs/getting-started/chart-categories.png" class="screenshot">
</div>

Creates a data visualization that effectively breaks down records based on the categorizaties you pick
 like the countries your top customers belong to or the top 20 workers in the sales department.
 
### Chart: Pie Charts

</div>

Break down company costs between different departments using a pie chart, or worker activity in a group using
a donut chart.

</div>
 
These charts are effective at providing insight on key performance indicators to make more informed 
business decisions. 

### Chart: Time Series
<div class="cerb-screenshot">
<img src="/assets/images/docs/getting-started/chart-timeseries.png" class="screenshot">
</div>

Using a time series, you can develop a visual aid that evolves over time to keep your workers motivated
 by displaying a gradual approach of daily to yearly goals and everything inbetween.

### Clocks
<div class="cerb-screenshot">
<img src="/assets/images/docs/getting-started/clock.png" class="screenshot">
</div>

Display the current time in any timezone in either 12-hour or 24-hour format using this clock widget.

### Countdowns
<div class="cerb-screenshot">
<img src="/assets/images/docs/getting-started/countdown.png" class="screenshot">
</div>

Show the time remaining until a deadline or important meeting with a countdown clock.

### Counters
<div class="cerb-screenshot">
<img src="/assets/images/docs/getting-started/counter.png" class="screenshot">
</div>

Count your open tickets or reports you still need to file. Keeping track of tasks that must
be completed to meet the daily quota is made much easier with counters.
 
### Custom Dashboards
<div class="cerb-screenshot">
<img src="/assets/images/docs/getting-started/customdashboard.png" class="screenshot"/>
</div>

Design dashboards unique to your own user experience. Cerb allows a user to customize their 
dashboards to keep track of their auto-reply and email categorization bot behaviors. 

### Gauges
<div class="cerb-screenshot">
<img src="/assets/images/docs/getting-started/gauge.png" class="screenshot">
</div>

Gauges are similar to a counter, but they allow you to create multiple thresholds
 within a range.  For instance, the average response time of a group can be displayed
 as a gauge with thresholds for "excellent", "acceptable", and "unacceptable".

### Knowledgebase Browsers
<div class="cerb-screenshot">
<img src="/assets/images/docs/getting-started/knowledgebase-browser.png" class="screenshot">
</div>

Knowledgebases illustrate how records, and custom records, like how an contact can link to emails 
and belong to an organization.

### Project Board
<div class="cerb-screenshot">
<img src="/assets/images/docs/getting-started/project-board.png" class="screenshot">
</div>

Have you ever lost track of all the tasks you need to work on or have completed already? Project boards
are effective for even the most overwhelmed worker. 

### Record Fields
<div class="cerb-screenshot">
<img src="/assets/images/docs/getting-started/record-fields.png" class="screenshot">
</div>

As your integration with Cerb deepens, you may want to keep specific record fields on your dashboard
to remind yourself how they work.
 
### Worklists
<div class="cerb-screenshot">
<img src="/assets/images/docs/getting-started/worklists.png" class="screenshot">
</div>

Quickly navigate through key tickets with a worklist.
