Before continuing you should have a copy of Cerb installed.

## Cerb Cloud

You can [sign up](/signup/) for a free trial of [Cerb Cloud](/cloud/).

We'll set up and manage everything for you. All you need is a web browser.

## Self-hosted

Alternately, you can [install Cerb on your own servers](/docs/installation/).

For testing and development, you can also [install Cerb in a local development environment](https://github.com/cerb/cerb-release/discussions/12).
