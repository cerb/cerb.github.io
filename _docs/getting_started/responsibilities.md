Every member of a [group](/docs/groups/) can be assigned a level of **responsibility** for each [bucket](/docs/buckets/).

The list of available work within the group is personalized for each person according to their skills and duties.

This avoids _"duplication of effort"_ -- a common situation in shared environments where everyone is constantly bumping into each other because they're all trying to find suitable work using the exact same list.

You're probably familiar with that issue if you've ever tried to share a traditional email account as a team (Gmail, Outlook).
