**Reminders** are scheduled messages to [workers](/docs/workers/) at a specific future date and time.

A reminder can be [linked](/docs/records/#links) to any number of [records](/docs/records/).

When a reminder is triggered, it may run any number of [bot](/docs/bots/) behaviors. These are typically different methods for contacting a worker depending on the urgency of the reminder (e.g. notification, email, mobile text message, Slack, etc).
