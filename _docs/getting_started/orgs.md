An **organization** is a group of related [contacts](/docs/contacts/).

For instance, the contacts may all be employees of the same company.

When information is stored on an organization, it is also available from any of its contacts. If you operate in a business-to-business (B2B) market, organization records are the ideal place to keep track of utilized products and services.
