A **worklist** is a [searchable](/docs/worklists/search/), [pageable](/docs/worklists/pagination/), [sortable](/docs/worklists/sorting/), and customizable set of [records](/docs/records/) displayed using rows and columns.

Each row of a worklist is a matching record, and each column is a particular [field](/docs/records/fields/) from that record. The displayed columns can be customized for each worklist based on your needs.

By saving a worklist, you'll always have an up-to-date view of matching records without wasting any time searching.

For instance, a worklist can display new customer messages that need a response, client organizations in a specific industry, tasks that are overdue, etc.
