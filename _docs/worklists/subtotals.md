Another useful feature in Cerb is the ability to **subtotal** worklists by grouping records with similar values for a given field.

Perhaps you want to subtotal organizations by country, email conversations by group, tasks by owner, etc.

<div class="cerb-screenshot">

</div>

Once you've subtotaled a list, you can click on a particular category to automatically add a new filter to the worklist.
