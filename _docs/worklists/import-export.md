Once you have a worklist filtered the way you want it, you can **export** data in CSV (comma-separated), JSON, or XML formats.  You also aren't limited to the fields displayed by the worklist; you can choose any fields, including those from related records.

Similarly, you can also **import** records on most worklists in CSV format.  You'll be given the opportunity to map columns in your import file to record fields.
