The most useful feature of worklists is their ability to pull out interesting sets of records from your data using [search queries](/docs/search/).

For instance, you can build a worklist of email messages sent by organizations in the health care industry who have an enterprise SLA and also have at least one female contact whose name starts with the letter 'M'.
