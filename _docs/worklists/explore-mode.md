When you need to view the [profile](/docs/profiles/) page of each matching [record](/docs/records/) in sequence, click the **explore** button below a worklist.  This will create a consistent snapshot of the worklist at the current point-in-time and allow you to navigate through it.  You can even send an explore set to another worker using its permalink.

You can use the `[` and `]` keyboard shortcuts to navigate backward and forward through the list, respectively.
