**Portals** provide a way to publicly and securely share Cerb data with your customers and partners.  Each portal is a standalone website built on top of Cerb.

There are various types of community portal:

* [Support Center](/docs/portals/support-center/)
* [Chat Bot](/docs/portals/chat-bot/)
* [Webhook Portal](/docs/portals/webhook/)

You can also create and install new community portal types with [plugins](/docs/plugins/).
