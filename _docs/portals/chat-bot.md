Traditionally, interactivity has been added to websites using forms. This requires front-end developers and designers to create pages, and back-end programmers to process form submissions and interact with other services (email, databases, APIs, etc).

With Cerb, you can build **chat bots** entirely from your web browser, and quickly deploy them to existing websites to assist visitors with:

* Contact methods
* Mailing list subscribe / unsubscribe
* Product explainers
* Signup
* Ordering
* Scheduling and booking
* Attendants
* Troubleshooters
* Surveys
* Feature requests and bug reporting
* ...and much more

This only requires a single line of code on your website.

You can embed bot interactions throughout your website, starting a specific conversation when a visitor clicks a link or button.  There's also a floating chat button in the bottom right of every page where your bots can help visitors discover their options.

You can also share links in email, chats, text messages, or social media posts, that automatically start a bot interaction on any page of your website.
