A bot **behavior** automatically makes decisions and performs actions in response to [events](/docs/events/).

A behavior is described by a **decision tree** made up of **nodes** -- a collection of relatively simple building blocks that can be chained together to do complex things.

There are five types of nodes: 

* [Decisions](/docs/bots/behaviors/decisions/)
* [Outcomes](/docs/bots/behaviors/decisions/)
* [Actions](/docs/bots/behaviors/actions/)
* [Loops](/docs/bots/behaviors/loops/)
* [Subroutines](/docs/bots/behaviors/subroutines/)
