# Interactions

**Interactions** are short conversations between a chat bot and a human user with a specific intent. They help avoid the challenges introduced by _open-ended_ conversations.

There are two types of bot interaction:

* [**Form interactions**](/docs/bots/interactions/forms/) build dynamic multi-step web forms that adapt in real-time based on user input.

* [**Chat interactions**](/docs/bots/interactions/chat/) determine a human's _intent_ (what they want to accomplish) from their _utterances_ in natural language and then to fulfill those requests in a helpful way.
