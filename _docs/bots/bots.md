**Bots** are automated team members.

They have fully customizable [behaviors](/docs/bots/behaviors/) which can make decisions and perform actions in response to many different [events](/docs/bots/events/).

For instance, a bot may [send an automatic reply](/guides/bots/send-automatic-replies/) back to a [contact](/docs/contacts/) when they start a new email conversation.

You can build and extend bots in Cerb using only your browser -- even if you lack computer programming experience.
