When activated by a behavior reaching it, an **action** node performs one or more operations in response.  There are actions to allow bots to do almost anything that a normal worker can do.  The available actions depend on the specific event that triggered the behavior.

Cerb comes with many built-in actions: setting a variable, sending an email, closing a ticket, creating a task, making an HTTP request, commenting on a record, loading filtered records from a worklist, notifying a worker, triggering another behavior to run, etc.

Plugins can also add new actions to behaviors: sending an SMS via Twilio, posting to Twitter or Facebook, retrieving customer information from Salesforce or LinkedIn, uploading a file to Amazon S3, and much more.
