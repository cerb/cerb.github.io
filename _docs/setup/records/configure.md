[Cards](/docs/cards/) provide a quick summary of a [record](/docs/records/) in a popup window.

In this section you can configure the [fields](/docs/records/#fields) that are displayed on a card for each record type. This is particularly useful when using [custom fields](/docs/records/#custom-fields).
