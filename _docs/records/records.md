At the core of Cerb is a **record** management system for organizing your team's data.

A record is a distinctly identifiable entity. When multiple records refer to the same kind of entity, we say that they are of the same **record type**.

Two pieces of information are needed to refer to any record:

1. The record type (e.g. contact, organization, reminder, task, worker).

1. The unique numeric identifier ("**ID**") within that particular record type. IDs are automatically assigned when a new record is created.

Cerb includes a set of common record types to help you get started.
