A **watcher** is a [worker](/docs/workers/) who has enabled [notifications](/docs/notifications/) for all new [activity](/docs/activity-log/) on a [record](/docs/records/). 

For example, a manager may be a watcher of all outgoing messages in a specific [group](/docs/groups/) to monitor the quality of the responses being sent to [clients](/docs/contacts/).

A worker who is assigned as a record's **owner** is automatically treated as a watcher for the duration of their ownership.
