The relationships between [records](/docs/records/) is described by **links**.

For instance, if a task is associated with a particular [organization](/docs/organizations/) then those records can be linked together.

When records are linked, they'll be displayed on each other's [cards](/docs/cards/) and [profiles](/docs/profiles/) for quick reference.
