**Notifications** keep [watchers](/docs/watchers/) informed about recent [activity](/docs/activity-log/) on a [record](/docs/records/).

When a worker has unread notifications, a red badge is displayed in the top right of every page:

<div class="cerb-screenshot">
<img src="/assets/images/docs/using-cerb/notifications/notifications-badge.png" class="screenshot">
</div>

Clicking on the notification badge opens a notifications [worklist](/docs/worklists/):

<div class="cerb-screenshot">
<img src="/assets/images/docs/using-cerb/notifications/notifications-popup.png" class="screenshot">
</div>

The links in the worklist open up [cards](/docs/cards/) for those relevant records. In many cases, a worker doesn't even need to leave the popup to act on their latest notifications.

<div class="cerb-screenshot">
<img src="/assets/images/docs/using-cerb/notifications/notifications-card.png" class="screenshot">
</div>

The summary on a card displays all the unread notifications on that record at the same time.  The notifications are automatically marked as read and the underlying worklist is refreshed.
