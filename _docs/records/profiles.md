Every [record](/docs/records/) has a dedicated page called its **profile**. The information on a profile is divided into any number of **tabs**.

Profiles are completely customizable. You can add your own tabs, and change or remove any of the default tabs that were created for you.

Each profile tab has a _type_ that determines what it displays. New profile tab types can be implemented with [plugins](/docs/plugins/).

By default, new profile tabs are [dashboards](/docs/dashboards/).
