While the built-in [record types](/docs/records/#record-types) cover things that every team has in common, you most likely needs to keep track of data that's specific to your team and industry.

In these situations, you can easily [create your own record types](/guides/records/custom-records/).

For instance:

* If you're a transportation company, your conversations may refer to physical trucks, planes, and ships in the real world.

* You can link contacts to records for your products, services, licenses, and subscriptions. During support, everyone on your team will know exactly what your relationship is with each contact.

* An educational institution can create records for students, instructors, courses, and rooms. Those records can then be linked to assets (like tablets and projectors) and support requests. If an instructor opened a support request about their projector being broken, you'd know exactly what model it is and where to find it on campus.
