Cerb can create interactive **map** visualizations with geospatial data from any source using the standard GeoJSON format.

A **map schema** is defined using [KATA](/docs/kata), which may include map resources, additional properties to fetch and merge, region colorization, point datasets, point sizing and colorization, labels, click interactions, and more.

# GeoJSON

GeoJSON[^geojson] is a text format for describing geometric (latitude/longitude) **features** for use in maps.

Each feature contains **geometry** to describe its shape, and a list of key/value **properties** to describe its attributes. This geometry is vector-based, so it can be sharply scaled to any size.

Individual locations, like cities, are represented as **points**. Perimeters -- such as continents, countries, states, roads, buildings, or geofences -- are represented as **polygons** (a sequence of points).

For instance, a GeoJSON document can contain geometry that describes the shape and position of every country. The same document can also include points for populous cities of those countries. Properties can include localized names, population, continent, identifiers, and so on.

# Resources

Detailed map data can be several megabytes in size, which would be cumbersome and redundant to include directly in a widget. Instead, map data is stored in reusable [**resource**](/docs/resources/) records. Each resource has a unique name, like `map.world.countries` or `map.country.germany`, which map KATA refers to. To improve performance, resources are cached in a client's web browser and automatically updated with changes.

There are three resource types for maps:

| Type | Description
|-|-
| **Map** | Features that describe regions in GeoJSON (e.g. countries, states, counties). These are base maps that other features are drawn on top of.
| **Map Points** | Points of interest to display on a base map in GeoJSON (e.g. cities, business locations).
| **Map Properties** | Additional JSON datasets (that can be merged into a base map (e.g. election results by state/county, COVID-19 cases per country).

Cerb includes several default resources that can be remixed into thousands of combinations:

| Name | Description
|-|-
| `map.world.countries` | The countries of the world
| `map.country.usa.states` | The states of the United States
| `map.country.usa.counties` | The counties of the United States
| `mapPoints.worldCapitalCities` | The capital city for every country
| `mapPoints.usaStateCapitals` | The capital city of each U.S. state

Resources can be file-based, with an uploaded file that infrequently changes, or automation-based, with a dynamically generated resource. For instance, an automation-based resource can fetch live data from any HTTP endpoint, transform it, and output the expected JSON format.

One map resource can form the basis of numerous visualizations. You can have hundreds of map widget variations, and a client's browser will only fetch the distinct resources once.

With map KATA, you can filter the `map.world.countries` resource to only display a single continent (e.g. Europe), a single country (e.g. Germany), or any combination of countries.

Similarly, the `map.country.usa.counties` resource can be filtered to display the counties of a single state or region. This one resource replaces 50+ individual U.S. state maps.

These are just the built-in examples. The same approach can be used to create resources for any map, of any region, at any level of detail.

Typically, you would download a "shapefile" from a government agency and convert it to the GeoJSON format, with a tool like `shp2json`.

However, if you just need a state/province level map for any country, we've already done that work for you in the [cerb/geojson-maps](https://github.com/cerb/geojson-maps/) repository. Countries are organized by their two-letter code ([iso_a2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2)). The repository also includes data sets for populated cities by country or continent. This is much more detail than provided in the default resources.

These resources are derived from [Natural Earth](https://www.naturalearthdata.com/) public domain data. They do not require attribution and do not have any limitations on their usage. 

# Maps KATA

As mentioned earlier, map schemas use [KATA](/docs/kata/), our human-friendly text format for structured data.

## Resource:

A map starts with a `map:resource:`:

<pre>
<code class="language-cerb">
{% raw %}
map:
  resource:
    uri: cerb:resource:map.country.usa.states
{% endraw %}
</code>
</pre>

Notice that the resource is referred to by a `map:resource:uri:` (uniform resource identifier). This always starts with a `cerb:` prefix, then a record type, another colon `:`, and ends with the unique identifier for a record of that type (an alias or record ID).

In the map editor, you can hold `Command` (Mac) or `Control` (Windows/Linux) to click on a resource URI and open its card popup.

## Projection:

Our planet is spherical, but you're probably used to looking at flat, rectangular maps.

A **projection** converts geospatial coordinates (latitude/longitude) into a flat plane (2D screen coordinates).

### type:

Cerb supports the following projection types:

#### mercator

Mercator has been the general purpose standard projection for nearly 500 years.

<pre>
<code class="language-cerb">
{% raw %}
map:
  projection:
    type: mercator
    scale: 90
{% endraw %}
</code>
</pre>

#### naturalEarth

Natural Earth is a relatively new projection, suitable for showing worldwide maps at a small scale.

<pre>
<code class="language-cerb">
{% raw %}
map:
  projection:
    type: naturalEarth
    scale: 90
{% endraw %}
</code>
</pre>

#### albersUsa

AlbersUSA is a "composite" projection for displaying a more compact map of the United States, with resized Alaska/Hawaii moved near the continental southwest.

<pre>
<code class="language-cerb">
{% raw %}
map:
  projection:
    type: albersUsa
    scale: 650
{% endraw %}
</code>
</pre>

### scale:

The `map:projection:scale:` key determines the initial size of the rendered map features. A larger number results in bigger shapes.

You can determine the ideal scale by panning and zooming the map, then looking at the current values in the bottom right.

<pre>
<code class="language-cerb">
{% raw %}
map:
  projection:
    type: mercator
    scale: 90
{% endraw %}
</code>
</pre>

### center:

The `map:projection:center:` key determines the default location at the center of the map's viewport. If omitted, the default is 0ยบ Latitude, 0ยบ Longitude (off the west coast of Africa).

<pre>
<code class="language-cerb">
{% raw %}
map:
  projection:
    type: mercator
    scale: 90
    center:
        latitude: 0
        longitude: 0
{% endraw %}
</code>
</pre>

<div class="cerb-box note">
<p>The <code>albersUsa</code> projection does not support this option, and is instead always centered on the United States by default. You can use <code>zoom:</code> to change the focus.</p>
</div>

### zoom:

While `map:projection:center:` determines the baseline map position, the `map:projection:zoom:` key allows you to procedurally pan and zoom the map. These changes can be reset back to the baseline by the user.

Interactions can also use the `zoom:` option to move around an existing map.

<pre>
<code class="language-cerb">
{% raw %}
map:
  projection:
    type: mercator
    scale: 90
    center:
        latitude: 0
        longitude: 0
    zoom:
        latitude: 37.98
        longitude: -97.74
        scale: 2
{% endraw %}
</code>
</pre>

The `map:projection:zoom:scale:` key is a zoom multiplier from `1` to `40`. 

## Regions:

The shapes in the base map are **regions** -- countries, states, etc.

When you click on a region on the map, you'll see a list of its key/value **properties** in the top left.

This makes it easy to explore the available properties while creating your map.

### properties:

To improve reusability, you can use `map:regions:properties:` to merge additional properties into the existing regions on a map.

#### data:

Use the `map:regions:properties:data:` key to specify additional properties to merge into the existing map regions.

<pre>
<code class="language-cerb">
map:
  resource:
    uri: cerb:resource:map.country.usa.states
  projection:
    type: albersUsa
    scale: 650
  regions:
    properties:
      data:
        CA:
          party: D
        TX:
          party: R
      join:
        property: postal
        case: upper
</code>
</pre>

#### resource:

Use the `map:regions:properties:resource:` key to fetch a 'Map Properties' [resource](/docs/resources/) and merge it into the existing map regions.

<pre>
<code class="language-cerb">
map:
  resource:
    uri: cerb:resource:map.country.usa.states
  projection:
    type: albersUsa
    scale: 650
  regions:
    properties:
      resource:
        uri: cerb:resource:mapProperties.usaStateAnimals
      join:
        property: name
        case: upper
</code>
</pre>

The map properties resource must have the following JSON object format:

<pre>
<code class="language-json">
{
    "VALUE_TO_MATCH": {
        "new_property": "some value",
        "another_new_property": "another value"
    },
    ...
}
</code>
</pre>

For instance:

<pre>
<code class="language-json">
{
    "CALIFORNIA": {
        "state_animal": "California grizzly bear" 
    },
    "TEXAS": {
        "state_animal": "Nine-banded armadillo"
    }
}
</code>
</pre>

#### join:

The top-level keys should uniquely identify a property of the base map (e.g. country/state). This is referenced in the `map:regions:properties:join:property:` key.

The join property must exactly match an existing property for each feature. You can use the `map:regions:properties:join:case:` key with a value of `upper` (upper case) or `lower` (lower case) to normalize the data. For instance, `case: upper` will match `camelCaps` using `CAMELCAPS` for both the join property and the feature property.

With this option you can join countless datasets to an existing map.

<div class="cerb-box note">
<p>It's a good idea to use standard properties like <code>iso_a2</code> to join properties to your map. These are already uniform and used by many third-party datasets.</p>
</div>

### label:

It's useful to be able to see all of the properties on a feature when designing your map. However, you'll likely eventually want to display only the data related to your visualization.

You can use the `map:regions:label:` key to control the contents of the floating label.

<pre>
<code class="language-cerb">
map:
  resource:
    uri: cerb:resource:map.country.usa.states
  projection:
    type: albersUsa
    scale: 650
  regions:
    properties:
      resource:
        uri: cerb:resource:mapProperties.usaStateAnimals
      join:
        property: name
        case: upper
    label:
      title: name
      properties:
        state_animal:
          label: Animal
        pop_est:
          label: Population
          format: number
</code>
</pre>

### filter:

Use `map:regions:filter:` to extract or omit certain features from a larger map resource.

#### is:
{: .no_toc}

Use `is:` to match a single property value:

<pre>
<code class="language-cerb">
map:
  resource:
    uri: cerb:resource:map.country.usa.states
  projection:
    type: albersUsa
    scale: 650
  regions:
    filter:
      property: name
      is: California
</code>
</pre>

#### is@list:
{: .no_toc}

Use `is@list:` or `is@csv:` to match multiple values in a single property:

<pre>
<code class="language-cerb">
map:
  resource:
    uri: cerb:resource:map.world.countries
  projection:
    type: mercator
    scale: 790
    center:
      latitude: 48.4088
      longitude: 8.2271
  regions:
    filter:
      property: name
      is@list:
        Austria
        Belgium
        France
        Germany
        Switzerland
</code>
</pre>

<div class="cerb-screenshot">
<img src="/assets/images/docs/maps/map-kata-regions-filter-in-list.png" class="screenshot">
</div>

#### not:
{: .no_toc}

Use `not:` to exclude a single property value:

<pre>
<code class="language-cerb">
map:
  resource:
    uri: cerb:resource:map.world.countries
  projection:
    type: mercator
    scale: 90
    center:
      latitude: 0
      longitude: 0
  regions:
    filter:
      property: continent
      not: North America
</code>
</pre>

<div class="cerb-screenshot">
<img src="/assets/images/docs/maps/map-kata-regions-filter-not.png" class="screenshot">
</div>

#### not@list:
{: .no_toc}

Use `not@list:` or `not@csv:` to exclude multiple values in a single property:

<pre>
<code class="language-cerb">
map:
  resource:
    uri: cerb:resource:map.world.countries
  projection:
    type: mercator
    scale: 90
    center:
      latitude: 0
      longitude: 0
  regions:
    filter:
      property: name
      not@csv: Australia, New Zealand, Antarctica
</code>
</pre>

### fill:

Map regions can be dynamically colorized based on property values.

Colors should be specified using [web colors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_colors) (CSS) syntax:

| Type | Examples
|-|-
| **Color names** | `aquamarine`, `red`, `black`
| **Hexadecimal** | `#FF0000`, `#646464`
| **RGB triplets** | `rgb(255,0,0)`, `rgba(0,200,0,0.5)`

#### color_key:

Use `map:regions:fill:color_key:` to select colors directly from a property.

<pre>
<code class="language-cerb">
map:
  regions:
    fill:
      color_key:
        property: country_color
</code>
</pre>

#### color_map:

Use `map:regions:fill:color_map:` to associate colors with specific property values.

<pre>
<code class="language-cerb">
map:
  regions:
    fill:
      color_map:
        property: scalerank
        colors:
          1: gray
          2: blue
          3: green
          4: orange
          5: red
</code>
</pre>

#### choropleth:

Use `map:regions:fill:choropleth:` to interpolate color intensity on a scale based on a numeric property.

<pre>
<code class="language-cerb">
map:
  regions:
    fill:
      choropleth:
        property: mapcolor9
        classes: 9
</code>
</pre>

<div class="cerb-screenshot">
<img src="/assets/images/docs/maps/map-kata-regions-fill-choropleth.png" class="screenshot">
</div>

## Points:

Points of interest can be plotted on a map using geospatial coordinates (latitude/longitude).

### resource:

Like map data, points can be loaded from a [resource](#resources) URI using `map:points:resource:`:

<pre>
<code class="language-cerb">
map:
  points:
    resource:
      uri: cerb:resource:mapPoints.worldCapitalCities
</code>
</pre>

<div class="cerb-screenshot">
<img src="/assets/images/docs/maps/map-kata-points-resource.png" class="screenshot">
</div>

### data:

You can also use `map:points:data:` to manually specify points and their properties. This is useful for map widgets; for instance, displaying an organization's location on its profile page, or displaying the approximate location of an IP address from an [interaction](/docs/interactions/).

If you specify both `map:points:resource:` and `map:points:data:`, the points will be merged into a single dataset.

<pre>
<code class="language-cerb">
map:
  points:
    data:
      point/berlin:
        latitude: 52.549636074382285
        longitude: 13.403320312499998
        properties:
          name: Berlin
          country: Germany
          continent: Europe
      point/los_angeles:
        latitude: 34.08906131584994
        longitude: 241.69921874999997
        properties:
          name: Los Angeles
          country: United States of America
          continent: North America
      point/sydney:
        latitude: -33.7243396617476
        longitude: 151.259765625
        properties:
          name: Sydney
          country: Australia
          continent: Oceania

<div class="cerb-box note">
<p>The website <a href="http://geojson.io/">http://geojson.io/</a> is very useful for finding point coordinates, or drawing simple shapes in GeoJSON.</p>
</div>

### label:

Like with regions, clicking on a point displays its properties. You can use `map:points:label:` to select which properties to show.

<pre>
<code class="language-cerb">
map:
  points:
    resource:
      uri: cerb:resource:mapPoints.worldCapitalCities

        Beijing
        Berlin
        London
        Moscow
        Washington, D.C.
</code>
</pre>

#### not:
{: .no_toc}

Use `not:` to exclude a single property value:

<pre>
<code class="language-cerb">
map:
  points:
    resource:
      uri: cerb:resource:mapPoints.worldCapitalCities
    filter:

      not@list:
        Asia
        Oceania
</code>
</pre>

### size:

Use `map:points:size:` to configure the size of each point.

#### default:

The `map:points:size:default:` key configures the default size for points which don't match any other rules. The size should be specified as a number.

<pre>
<code class="language-cerb">
map:
  points:
    resource:
      uri: cerb:resource:mapPoints.worldCapitalCities
    size:
      default: 2.5

</pre>

#### value_map:

Use `map:points:size:value_map:` to associate point sizes based on the value of a property.

<pre>
<code class="language-cerb">
map:
  points:
    resource:
      uri: cerb:resource:mapPoints.worldCapitalCities
    size:

# Zooming and panning

Maps can be zoomed with a mouse-wheel, or with the '+' and '-' buttons in the top right of the widget.

You can pan a map by clicking on any region or point. Maps can't be panned from whitespace (e.g. ocean), which makes it easier to scroll past a widget without unintentionally zooming.

# Handling clicks with automations

On map widgets, a 'Map clicked' (map.clicked) [automation](/docs/automations/) can be added using [event handler](/docs/automations/#events) KATA.

The first enabled automation receives the event with inputs for the `feature_type` (`region` or `point`), `feature_properties` (from the GeoJSON), an optional `widget_*` dictionary, and the current `worker_*`.

The `return` dictionary may include a `sheet:` key with a schema to display for the clicked feature, using the feature properties.

# Example: COVID-19 cases in the U.S.

Suppose we want to visualize COVID-19 cases in the United States by the severity of each state's incident rate (i.e. cases per 100K population). We'll call this "Covid-19 Incident Rate per 100K".

### Choosing our resource and projection

We've learned that we can use the built-in `map.country.usa.states` [resource](#resources) to display a map of the United States.

Visualizations of the United States often use a compact format with a smaller Alaska, and larger Hawaii, shown closer to the continental states than their true locations. We'll use the [albersUsa](#albersusa) projection to achieve this effect.

Our map KATA begins with:

<pre>
<code class="language-cerb">
{% raw %}
map:
  resource:
    uri: cerb:resource:map.country.usa.states
  projection:
    type: albersUsa
    scale: 650
{% endraw %}
</code>

This shows all 50 states in a compact format, and scaled up to fill the widget:

</div>

### Creating a properties resource

Now we want to colorize the states based on their incident rate. The map doesn't include this data by default, so we need to find some data for our new 'Map Properties' resource.

A quick search discovers a GitHub repository with daily reports of COVID-19 levels in the U.S.:
<https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_daily_reports_us>

We'll grab the latest report (2020-11-23, at the time of writing).

This is a comma-separated value file (`.csv`). We need to convert it to our 'Map Properties' JSON format.

For demonstration, we'll do the conversion manually, so you're better prepared to create your own resources.

You could write a simple script for this in any programming language; but you can also use the **Setup >> Developers >> Bot Scripting Tester** and write a quick and disposable script in Cerb's [bot scripting](/docs/bots/scripting/) language.

We can copy the output above and save it to a file with a name like `usa-covid-2020-11-23.json.txt`.

Now we can create a new resource in Cerb from **Search >> Resources** by clicking the **(+)** icon above the list.

<div class="cerb-screenshot">
<img src="/assets/images/docs/maps/map-kata-example-resource-file.png" class="screenshot">
</div>

After saving the file, we can refer to it by name in our map KATA.

<pre>
<code class="language-cerb">
map:
  resource:
    uri: cerb:resource:map.country.usa.states
  projection:
    type: albersUsa
    scale: 650
  regions:
    properties:
      join:
        property: name
      resource:
        uri: cerb:resource:mapProperties.usaCovidByState
</code>
</pre>

The map doesn't look any different yet, but if you click on any state then you'll see that the new `covid_` properties have been merged into the bottom of the list:

<div class="cerb-screenshot">
<img src="/assets/images/docs/maps/map-kata-example-merged-properties.png" class="screenshot">
</div>

We can use the `map:regions:fill:choropleth` feature and the `covid_incident_rate` property to colorize the map.

<pre>
<code class="language-cerb">
map:
  resource:
    uri: cerb:resource:map.country.usa.states
  projection:
    type: albersUsa
    scale: 650
  regions:
    properties:
      join:
        property: name
      resource:
        uri: cerb:resource:mapProperties.usaCovidByState
    fill:
      choropleth:
        property: covid_incident_rate
        classes: 8
</code>
</pre>

We can now easily see that the darker states have a higher incidence rate of the virus:

<div class="cerb-screenshot">
<img src="/assets/images/docs/maps/map-kata-example-choropleth.png" class="screenshot">
</div>

### Simplifying the labels

Now we can configure the labels to only show the virus-related properties:

<pre>
<code class="language-cerb">
map:
  resource:
    uri: cerb:resource:map.country.usa.states
  projection:
    type: albersUsa
    scale: 650
  regions:
    properties:
      join:
        property: name
      resource:
        uri: cerb:resource:mapProperties.usaCovidByState
    fill:
      choropleth:
        property: covid_incident_rate
        classes: 8
    label:
      title: name_en
      properties:
        covid_incident_rate:
          label: Cases/100K
          format: number
        covid_testing_rate:
          label: Tests/100K
          format: number
        covid_cases_confirmed:
          label: Cases Confirmed
          format: number
        covid_deaths:
          label: Deaths
          format: number
        covid_recovered:
          label: Recovered
          format: number
        covid_active:
          label: Active
          format: number
</code>
</pre>

And we see a much more readable label:

<div class="cerb-screenshot">
<img src="/assets/images/docs/maps/map-kata-example-labels.png" class="screenshot">
</div>

### Conclusion

You can use the same process to gather and visualize data from anywhere.

In production, we'd create a resource automation to pull the latest report via HTTP and automatically convert it from CSV to JSON. We'd only need to do that once, and we'd always have the latest data in the widget.

A resource automation could also fetch properties using a [data query](/docs/data-queries/).

For instance, you could colorize countries or regions based on the number of clients you have in that area, with the darker regions having a higher density of clients.
