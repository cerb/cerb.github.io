A **workspace** is a page designed to optimize a particular workflow.  Workspaces can be shared by everyone, shared within a [group](/docs/groups/) or [role](/docs/roles/), or private to a specific [worker](/docs/workers/).

You can add any number of workspace pages to your [navigation bar](/docs/navigation/#pages) and personalize Cerb into your own mission control.

Workspaces use **tabs** to organize their content into sections; much like dividers are used to partition pages in a large binder.

The two most common types of tabs on workspaces are [worklists](/docs/worklists/) and [dashboards](/docs/dashboards/).
