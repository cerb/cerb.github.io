**Dashboards** provide visual insight with collections of highly customizable **widgets**.

Dashboards are **responsive** -- they automatically adapt to various screen sizes on different devices. If you have a narrow screen like a smartphone held vertically, you may only be able to display a single column of widgets. On a much larger desktop display, the same dashboard could display multiple horizontal columns of widgets.

Widgets can have different sizes relative to each other. For example, a large chart may be configured to display 2-4x as wide as the widgets adjacent to it when that much space is available.

By configuring the **layout** of a dashboard, different **zones** become available for widgets to use. For instance, two zones could be a left-hand sidebar and a larger content area to the right of it. Widgets determine their size based on the zone they are in. These zones will also collapse to a single column when a device's screen is too narrow.
